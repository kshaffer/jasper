Since I'm introducing people to Twitter for multiple events this summer (online classes and (un)conferences), I created a couple videos to help those new to Twitter get their bearings. If you're new to Twitter, or just want to know what it's about, check out these videos. In them, I aim particularly at academics that might use them in classes or conferences, but the basic mechanics are the same no matter what.

Enjoy!
