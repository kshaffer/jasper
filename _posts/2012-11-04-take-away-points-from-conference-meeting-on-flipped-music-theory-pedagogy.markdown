Things went so quickly at our Saturday meetup to discuss the flipped music theory class that I didn't get a chance to live tweet. I also don't think anyone took notes! A lot of the discussion came out of questions about specific situations people found themselves in. However, there were a few takeaways for me that are generalizable, so I thought I'd put them here, perhaps as an impetus for further discussion and to help those who couldn't make it have an idea of the kinds of things we discussed. (Sorry, by the way, that the email I posted to the SMT listserv did not clear moderation before the meeting. Out of my control, unfortunately.) I'll also throw in a few things that came up in private conversations and over dinners.

The first takeaway is that those using flipped techniques (including video content delivery, peer instruction, clickers, project-based learning, significant in-class exercises, and standards-based or criterion-referenced grading) do so in as many different ways as there are people using them! The specific motivations were just as diverse.

Because of this diversity, and because there is such a strong relationship for some of us between the flipped teaching methods and methods of assessment and course objectives, there has been some discussion about finding a better term to encompass these things. For example, for me the flipped methods are related to and grow out of my course objectives and my standards-based grading, and they have become a single package for me. It might, then, be helpful to come up with a name for the broader category of pedagogical philosophy that includes these tools and methods. The difference between instructor-centered or content-centered teaching and student-centered or objective-centered teaching or learning was discussed. (I kind of like the term _objective-oriented_, since course objectives are the foundation for me, and since it puns on object-oriented programming.)

Another takeaway: standard theory curriculum assumes every student has A-level knowledge of preceding material. How would our curriculum change if we assumed every student had C-minus-level knowledge of all preceding material? 

Flipped techniques, especially video content delivery, allow for greater uniformity between instructors teaching the same course. Helpful for universities where TAs or TFs teach courses but aren't on the same page. It also gives a context for individualization of class activities within a standard framework of content.

Common misconceptions about flipped classes are that it will run teachers out of a job (rendering them replaceable by video) or that it will make it easier for a teacher to take on a fuller load. Neither are true. In fact, it is likely the opposite.

We also discussed some of the difficulties in making a flipped class work in a course sequence where other courses are not flipped. This comes up in various situations: flipping second-year theory with students who took non-flipped first-year theory courses, flipping first year and sending them off to non-flipped second year, and teaching a flipped section of theory alongside other non-flipped sections.

Lastly, we discussed the need and the potential advantages of having more discussions online and sharing resources using various tools. (I like the idea of github myself.) To facilitate these discussions, I started a branch discussion and invited those who attended and those who expressed interest but couldn't make it to join the discussion. We can talk about the best ways to share resources and keep the discussions going post-conference. If you'd like to join that discussion, go [here](http://branch.com/b/flipped-and-objective-oriented-pedagogy-in-music-theory) and click "ask to join."

I hope that's helpful both for those who attended and for those who were unable to come but want to keep up with the discussion, or at least learn more about it. Please leave comments and questions below or go to the branch discussion.
