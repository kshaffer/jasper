Colleen and I will be playing in the pit for [Carmen](http://charlestonsymphony.org/Events/Denyce-Graves-as-CARMEN-with-Opera-Charleston.aspx) next weekend, with Denyce Graves, Opera Charleston, and the Charleston Symphony Orchestra. It will be fun to play in an orchestra together again! We're playing third and fourth horn, so it will be just like old times in the Berkshire Symphony.

Rehearsals overlap with a few of my classes, but my department chair wants me to pursue performing locally as much as I can. Since I have to miss a few classes, it will be a good opportunity to build on our recent focus on peer instruction and see what the students are able to do when I'm not there. As I tweeted a couple weeks ago, my best class so far has been the one in which I made the students do all the talking. We'll see what they come up with when I'm not there!
