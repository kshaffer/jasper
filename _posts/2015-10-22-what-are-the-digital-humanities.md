What Are the Digital Humanities?

That's the topic of discussion for the round-table session I'll be leading at UT–Austin today. If you're in town, please join us in MRH 2.614, 4:00–5:30pm CDT. Otherwise, you join us on Twitter at the same time, following/tweeting with the hashtag [#PublicScholar.](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23PublicScholar&src=typd)

Here is the abstract for the session: 

> What is the difference between "digital" humanities (DH) and traditional scholarly work in the humanities? Are they different in content as well as in form? Or perhaps neither? Are the digital humanities about "building stuff" or "breaking stuff"? Hack or yack? And is digital pedagogy part of DH, or something else entirely?

> Kris Shaffer (CU–Boulder & Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing) will lead this open discussion of what DH is. The answer to that question is likely elusive, but it's not the answer that's interesting. As with most digital "innovations" in the academy, DH isn't as new as it sounds, but it does prompt us to engage questions that have gone unasked for too long, questions that get at the heart of what we do in the arts and the humanities, and the politics that frame that activity. Come listen, yack, perhaps even hack as we explore the philosophy behind our practice ― our praxis ― in the humanities.

To get the ball rolling, here are a few different perspectives on the question, all from DH scholars who are wiser and more experienced in the field than I am...

> "Digital Humanities is about building things. ...  
[I]f you aren’t building, you are not engaged in the 'methodologization' of the humanities, which, to me, is the hallmark of the discipline that was already decades old when I came to it."

Stephen Ramsay, [Who's In and Who's Out](http://stephenramsay.us/text/2011/01/08/whos-in-and-whos-out/)

> "The heart of the digital humanities is not the production of knowledge; it’s the reproduction of knowledge. ...
It's about challenging the ways that knowledge is represented and shared."

Mark Sample, [The digital humanities is not about building, it’s about sharing](http://www.samplereality.com/2011/05/25/the-digital-humanities-is-not-about-building-its-about-sharing/)

> "The digital humanities asks us to pervert our reading practices — to read backwards, as well as forwards, to stubbornly not read, and to rethink how we approach learning in the digital age."

Jesse Stommel, [The Digital Humanities is About Breaking Stuff](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/the-digital-humanities-is-about-breaking-stuff/)

> "If you look through the projects that have been funded in the last decade you’re going to see a lot of repeated themes. ... You’re going to see a lot of emphasis on tools. A lot of emphasis on big data analysis. A lot of emphasis on computation, and the power of computation. What *aren’t* you going to see as much of? Emphasis on *why computing*, the *conditions under which computing is manufactured*, a *cultural analysis* of the ideologies of computing. Why is that?"

Adeline Koh, [A Letter to the Humanities: DH Will Not Save You](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/a-letter-to-the-humanities-dh-will-not-save-you/)

So what do you think? What is DH about? *building? sharing? breaking? big data? cultural analysis? all of the above? something else entirely?*
