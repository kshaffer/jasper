Using standards-based or criterion-referenced assessment forces me to think about course objectives. In a traditional grading scheme, it's more natural to think about content that needs to be covered, but when students will be evaluated on whether or not they meet certain criteria or standards, the curricular emphasis shifts to thinking about course objectives. This, of course, includes learning content, but there are also skills to master and concepts to get a handle on. As I've been revamping my grading plans, then, it's been turning my attention to these course objectives. And as I've been thinking about these course objectives for the whole four-semester musicianship sequence, I've been thinking about just what kind of musicians I want my students to become.

Here's how I describe that musicianship goal in [the most recent draft of my curriculum plan and syllabuses](https://github.com/kshaffer/musicianship-curriculum):



> The four-semester Musicianship course sequence seeks to lead students to become well-rounded musicians, with a strong foundation in the theory and practice of Western music. Given the fast changing landscape of musical careers, the best training involves mastery of skills with broad applicability, coupled with deep knowledge of a variety of musical genres and experience applying skills and knowledge to new genres. With that in mind, the CSU Musicianship courses seek to lay a solid, broad foundation, and explore several different musical styles in detail.

On the whole, this goal is achieved by bringing students to a deep understanding of music theory and its relationship to musical practice. The CSU Musicianship courses also seek to develop students' mastery of foundational musical skills relating to listening and performing, and develop students' ability to think critically and communicate verbally about music, primarily through writing about music and responding to the writings of others. Lastly, students are expected to master the use of both traditional and modern technology (including pencil, paper, and the piano on one hand, and computer- and web-based tools on the other) in their musical activities and grow in their ability to discern the best tools for specific tasks.



I also put together a list of "conceptual" objectives. These will not be the basis of their grading, but things I've had in mind as I've been designing the new grading scheme and course layout. They express the overall conceptual knowledge I want my students to have by the end of their time in my courses.






  * Understand the principles of good melodic composition.  
  * Understand the principles of good interaction between musical voices.  
  * Understand the significance and potential roles of of melody in setting text to music.  
  * Understand the significance and potential roles of of harmony in setting text to music.  
  * Understand the significance and potential roles of of form in setting text to music.  
  * Understand basic formal functions and formal modules, as well as the relationship between them.  
  * Understand harmonic functions and their relationship to formal functions.  
  * Identify key markers of a musical style.  
  * Communicate verbally about music, clearly and persuasively.  
  * Understand the relationships of different genres within Western tonal music.  
  * Apply skills and knowledge gained in the study of one genre to the study of a new genre.  
  * Critically evaluate and respond to others' thoughts on music, and do so respectfully.  
  * Understand the relationships between the theory, practice, and history of music.



I'm sure there are other things that can be said (and I'd be interested in feedback along those lines). But this is my best attempt so far at describing just what it is I want my students to get out of these classes. The goal should not be _get through Textbook X in two years relatively unscathed_. Rather, decisions about class content, textbooks (or websites or media sources), assignments, and projects should be designed around a goal. This is my goal.
