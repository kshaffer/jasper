I was looking at old course websites as I plan for the fall, and I ran across this post from the Aural Skills I website from last semester. I'm so glad that with the new grading system I didn't have to post something like this this semester!



> For the last three assignments, there have been a total of 27 zeroes! (one-third of the two sections) That is unacceptable, and it has knocked a few of you below the passing mark for the first time in the semester. It is too late to submit the Chapter 14 listening assignment or the compound-meter notation assignment for credit. However, since the listening assignment from Chapter 16 was due in our last class, you can still submit it tomorrow for a 20% late penalty. It will be a zero if you submit it on Thursday. Please turn that in if you haven’t already.

Keep in mind that homework and in-class evaluations are worth 55% of the final grade, which means that each homework assignment is worth about 2.5% of your final grade. The median for the class is 2 missing assignments—half of a letter grade—and half of you have more than that missing. In fact, everyone who is below the 70% mark has at least 4 zeroes—an entire letter grade, and in some cases the _only reason_ you are failing. For those of you who have just recently started to miss assignments, _please_ get the remaining homework in on time. Do not fail at the last second simply because you are too lazy to do the homework!
