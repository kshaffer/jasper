I have decided to resume blogging on issues related to humanities scholarship and the Christian faith. This is something that I used to do quite a bit. However, my heavy teaching load at CSU cut into my blogging time, and when I did have time to blog, I found myself focusing more on issues of music theory and pedagogy. Now, I anticipate having more time to blog regularly, and I've been mulling over the relationship of faith and scholarship more lately, so it seems like a good time to revisit this topic in my writing. I'll begin this endeavor mainly by re-posting or updating posts from my old blog, and eventually building on that foundation with some new posts.

I began that old blog with a post quoting the opening of John Calvin's *Institutes of the Christian Religion*, and it is a fitting introduction to this new topic on my current blog. In the opening of his *Institutes*, Calvin lays out his view of the purpose of humanistic study. We often hear the humanities summed up by the question, "What does it mean to be human?" Calvin gives an answer rarely heard from humanists, but a fitting introduction to a blog exploring the intersection of the Christian faith and humanistic scholarship. I'll hold off on commenting on it for now. These words are good for a Christian to let sink in for a while.

> The whole sum of our wisdom which is worth calling true and certain is practically comprised of two parts: that is, the knowledge of God and of ourselves. Of these, the first ought to show us not only that there is only one God whom all must worship and honor, but also that the same One is the fountain of all truth, wisdom, goodness, righteousness, judgment, mercy, power, and holiness, so that we may learn to expect and ask everything from Him, and also to acknowledge with praise and thanksgiving that all these things come from Him. The second part, by showing us our weakness, wretchedness, futility, and greed, leads us to feel cast down about and to distrust and hate ourselves; and then kindles in us a desire to seek for God, since in Him lies all the good of which we are empty and naked (p. 23).
