This past week on Twitter, [Lee Bessette](http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/college-ready-writing) floated the idea of creating a database of academic blogs in a wide range of fields. After discussing some of the practical issues for creating and publishing such a database, [Lee](https://twitter.com/readywriting), [Alexander Fink](https://twitter.com/alexfink), [Melanie Schlosser](https://twitter.com/m_b_schlosser), and I put together a Google form to collect resources from academic bloggers (and followers) that will feed into a spreadsheet that is (eventually) publicly viewable.

The list itself should be a great resource for anyone looking to find other blogs in specific fields. However, once that spreadsheet becomes more populated, we will enter the list into the newly released beta version of the [PressForward plugin for WordPress](https://github.com/PressForward/pressforward). This will allow us to explore options for aggregating and curating content, as individuals or in teams.

This curation option was already something that the IT/Networking Committee of the Society for Music Theory discussed . . . and charged me with exploring on the committee's behalf. Since there are only a few music theorists blogging on a regular basis (that I know of), this project of Lee's will give me a good base to start with for exploring curation options. In turn, I hope that good curation and aggregation options will encourage more music theorists to blog regularly.

If you have an academic blog, please add it to the database. You can do so using the form embedded below.
