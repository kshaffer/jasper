At [FlipCamp Music Theory](http://flipcampmt.wordpress.com), I shared my approach to [inquiry-driven learning](2013/01/species-counterpoint-twitter-inquiry-based-learning-and-the-inverted-class/) in a music theory class (now an essay in [*Engaging Students*](http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents/shafferpt3.html), an ebook on student-centered pedagogy in music courses). In the discussion that followed, [Bryn Hughes](http://www.brynhughes.org) suggested the possibility of students creating their own textbook as the result of this inquiry process, and I loved the idea. I'm going to try it this semester.

My sophomore theory class will be divided into three units for the fall semester: species counterpoint, keyboard-style voice-leading, and German art song. For each unit, class activity will center around the creation of a *primer* for the topic. The primer will define all terms and concepts and provide instructions for composing and analyzing music in the style studied. The accuracy of the primer will be tested by in-class analysis and demonstrations, and ultimately by some sort of unit-end project where the students use the primer as the basis of their project work. 

I'm excited about the potential pedagogical value of this kind of project. I've seen the advantages of students discovering the "rules" and logic of different musical styles for themselves (as opposed to reading from a textbook or listening to a lecture). I've also experienced how a writing project draws attention to holes in logic and understandingâ€”both for my students, and for myself. And, of course, there is the value of collaborative learning, particularly when matched with individual nose-to-the-grindstone work. This project combines all of those advantages into a single task.

Managing the practical side will be a bit more of a challenge. The priorities in choosing a technological tool for this task are that it be free and accessible for the students, that it can handle multiple people working simultaneously, and that it can allow tracking of contributions and edits made by each individual involved. A bonus would be if it has the potential to scale much larger, since I hope to teach a MOOC next summer that will involve a similar project. I looked into Google Docs, [Draft](http://draftin.com), [GitHub](http://github.com), and GitHub's wiki feature. Ultimately, I've chosen to try GitHub. Of the four, it is the most involved technically. However, it has the best tracking and the best potential for scaling, and it's free in many more senses of the word than Google or Draft. I know that I'll have to do a lot of hand-holding to make it work. However, since the semester starts with a unit that should be mostly review for the students in terms of content, that unit will be a great time to help the students get used to the technology. Hopefully, as material progresses from review to new-take-on-something-previously-covered to completely new, the students will become more comfortable with the technology. And, of course, I'm not opposed to changing tools mid-semester if necessary.

As I'm planning, I'm wondering if anyone else has conducted a similar project. If so, what tools did you use? How did it go? Did you (would you) do the same thing again? Please leave a comment and let me know what you think!
