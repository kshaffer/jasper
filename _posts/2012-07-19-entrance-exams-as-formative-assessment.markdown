We are in the midst of giving musicianship entrance exams to incoming students for the CSU music program. These exams traditionally are meant to set a standard that incoming students must meet in order to be admitted into Musicianship I. Students that fail the exam must take and pass a course in music fundamentals (basic musical notation and aural skills) before being admitted to Musicianship I.

The musicianship entrance exams still fulfill that purpose. If students don't have certain basic knowledge or skills, placing them right into Musicianship I will simply set them up for failure. Thus they are placed into fundamentals to give them a chance to nail down those basic concepts and skills before jumping into the full course sequence. 

(I should note that many of the students who are placed in fundamentals are, or will make, fine musicians. However, a growing number of music students are entering music school without their previous teachers ensuring they know basic things like scales, key signatures, meter, etc. The deficiency is not with the students, but with their previous teachers, in such cases, and that is easily fixed.)

However, as I've been grading the entrance exams conducted so far, I've found that many students who pass (according to the more-or-less arbitrary standard I set when making the exam) still lack certain knowledge. For instance, the majority of students who pass under the original standard failed the portions of the exam that focused on scale recognition and scale writing. My reaction to that is that if the majority of students in the class come in without a necessary foundational concept or skill, I need to teach it before we build on it. And if I need to teach it, I can't require it of incoming students in order to be placed in the class.

So I recalculated test scores without scale recognition and scale writing, and a few more people passed and were admitted to Musicianahip I.

Of course, there are things that must be known before a student is ready to succeed in Musicianahip I. But some things (like scales) can be taught quickly if the students have that basic knowledge. This got me thinking more deeply about the entrance exam as formative assessment. If the majority of incoming music majors lack a piece of knowledge that can be taught quickly, why shouldn't I just add it to the Musicianship I plan? Especially when the alternative is students failing the entrance exam and falling a year behind their classmates.

So I decided that anything that can be taught quickly (or studied individually) that the majority of incoming students lacked would not count against them in the entrance exam evaluations. Rather, I would add those things to the docket for Musicianship I. 

To be sure, there are a number of students who will still need fundamentals (or perhaps a change in major; better to find that out early!). However, I found a number of students who already possess the basics that take time to develop, but lack some things that can be learned quickly and independently. Needing 2-3 weeks of extra work should not put someone a year behind. And so it won't. Provided they rise to the challenge and succeed in Musicianship I this fall.

I'm wondering if others have thought this way about entrance exams. In a big department, it may not be possible. But in a small, skills-based department with a single instructor for the courses in question, it seems to make sense. Education is about helping a student get from point A to point B. To accomplish that, an educator needs to know what point A is. So it seems to me that entrance exams are the ideal place to find that out, and adjust accordingly.

Do others with more experience than me have thoughts about this?
