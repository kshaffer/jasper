I recently read Carl Trueman's _Histories and Fallacies: Problems Faced in the Writing of History_. It is an excellent and easy to read introduction to historiography, and Trueman is refreshing in that he is sensitive to both the value and the pitfalls of postmodern scholarship and New Criticism. Specifically, he has handled the problem of _evidence_ in the age of _subjectivity_ very well. I highly recommend this book to every undergraduate student, and to anyone who reads history, watches documentaries, or aspires to write history. Not only will you get a good intro to the methods of doing history, and many things to avoid, but you will come away with a list of other sources more detailed and specific to read next that will guide you through further stage(s) of your development as a student, writer, or connoisseur of history.

I'll probably refer to this book in a few more blog posts, but in this one, I'd like to touch on just one part of Trueman's argument in _Histories and Fallacies_, from his third chapter, 'The Past is a Foreign Country.' Trueman writes:


> [I]n history it is the exceptional things, not the ordinary, that require explanation; but one can only discern the exceptional once one knows what "ordinary" is in a given context (p. 132).


To illustrate this point, Trueman explores two examples: one relating to John Calvin, one to Martin Luther. (Did I mention he was a church historian that specializes in the Reformation?) But this point rang home quite clearly for me because I was in the midst of writing my final dissertation chapter when I read this. In that chapter, I deal with a number of music scholars who ascribe to György Ligeti (a 20th-c. Hungarian composer whose music is the focus of my dissertation) honored status as one who vehemently opposed the serialists. (You don't need to know who the serialists were, except that they were the leading 'elite' or avant-garde composers in mid-20th-c. Europe, and that most people today don't like their music or their aesthetic positions.) They base this largely on (negative) statements made by Ligeti about serialism, stopping short of an analysis of Ligeti's music or his polemical discourse on music to reveal what is going on more deeply. The problem is that many serialist composers make the same statements about the problem of serialism. Rather than being exceptional, it is quite ordinary for these avant-garde composers to attempt to set themselves apart from the School, assert their individuality, and out-progress their fellow progressives.

I'll spare you the details of my dissertation. (It will be on my website soon if you want to read about this rather fascinating situation in the history and theory of music.) The point is that we need a lot of context to determine what something in history means, and sometimes that means a lot of digging. This is true in any discipline that involves the study of the past—recent or distant. Surface reading of any text, or reading in isolation, will only get us so far—and sometimes even that is in the wrong direction.
