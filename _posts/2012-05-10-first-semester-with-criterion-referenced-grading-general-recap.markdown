All in all, I'm very happy with the way things turned out this semester incorporating the new grading system. There are a few tweaks I'd like to make next year, but I'm definitely not going back to the old system of holistic, average-based grading. In this post, I thought I'd offer a brief summary of what I did differently this semester (including a couple tweaks to the system that I made mid-semester), what I (and my students) thought went well, and what I (and my students) thought needed improvement with a few thoughts on how those specific things might be improved.



## What it looked like



In the past, I have used a traditional grading system where each assignment is given a single holistic letter grade, those grades are grouped according to assignment type (homework, quiz, test, etc.) and averaged, and the final grade is determined by giving those averages appropriate weights and averaging them.

For each class this past semester, I created a list of criteria that the students needed to meet in order to pass the class. This list was exactly the list of course objectives. These criteria were essentially topical categories like _keyboard-style voice-leading_, _functional-bass analysis_, _sight-singing – rhythm_, or _use of music notation software_. Each assignment was graded according to each criterion covered in the assignment. For instance, a voice-leading assignment typically was given grades for five categories: voice-leading, functional bass, harmonic syntax, cadences, and notation software. A sight-singing exam would receive grades for rhythm, diatonic pitch, solfege syllables, and—if applicable—chromatic pitch and/or modulation.

At the beginning of the semester, I told students that they must achieve a passing grade (3 or 4 on a 4-point scale) for each criterion on the list of course objectives to pass the class. The final grade would be determined by the number of 3s and 4s they had.

(More details on what we did this semester, and on criterion-referenced grading in general—also called standards-based grading, particularly in the sciences—can be found by clicking on the "criterion-referenced grading" tag to the right of this post.)

The main change that I made mid-semester was to allow students to have non-passing grades in up to two categories (out of ten) in Music Theory II and Aural Skills II. I did not do this for Theory and Aural Skills IV, mainly because I didn't need to. But I also made this change because next year's classes will allow this year's Theory and Aural Skills II students more changes to develop their skills in these areas. If they are passing almost all of them, they don't need another semester to prepare for level III; they just need another pass at the material in a new context, or maybe some time brushing up over the summer. If that's the case, they shouldn't fail the class. By the end of the course sequence, however, I expect them all to get there, and so I didn't allow any non-passing grades for any of the course objectives in level IV.

I was purposefully vague about any formulas for calculating the final grade in my syllabus, since I hadn't done this before. I didn't want to back myself into a corner. What I wanted was a system where students who fulfill the course objectives and are ready to go on to the next level would get a passing grade, students who do not fulfill the objectives and are not ready to go on would get a failing grade, and where mid-semester grades would give students _information_ about where they are, where they need to be, and where to focus their efforts most intently. In other words, all but the final grade should be _formative_ rather than _summative_ assessments.

In the end, I calculated final grades for Theory and Aural Skills II (where I had the most students and needed the most objective system to ensure consistency) as follows. Students who passed 10 out of 10 categories were given an A or a B+. (CSU does not give minuses, and only gives pluses for B and C. Don't ask why; I don't know.) Students who passed 9 out of 10 categories were given a C+, B, or B+. Students who passed 8 out of 10 were given a C or C+. Anything else was given a D or an F because they did not meet the requirements for passing the class (only A–C is passing).

The specific grades within those ranges were obtained using a weighted median of their categorical grades. In essence, I made a list of their category grades, repeating each grade according to its weight. So, for example, I may have listed voice-leading 6 times, but notation software only 3 times, and functional bass 4 times. Then I took the median grade on that list. All passing students had a median of 3, 3.5, or 4. That median placed their grade within the ranges. (This weighted median prevented me from giving a student with 4s only in categories that were easy, or which accounted for only a small amount of work during the semester, the same grade as a student with the same number of 4s but in "harder" or more substantial categories.)

So a student that passed all 10 categories with a weighted median of 4 got an A. A student that passed 9 categories with a weighted median of 4 got a B+, as did a student who passed 10 but had a weighted median of 3. A student who just barely fulfilled the requirements with 8 passing categories and a weighted median of 3 got a C, the lowest passing grade.



## What went well



First, a greater portion of students passed this semester, even though I held them to a higher standard of mastery. There were also far fewer mid-semester withdrawls. Now, the grading system was not the only potential contributing factor. My students and I knew each other much better, and they trusted me more this semester than my first. We also incorporated less lecture and more in-class work. There were several other changes as well. However, my impression (and that of my students) was that the grading scheme made a positive impact here. (See my [earlier post](/2012/05/student-feedback-on-criterion-referenced-grading/) with the results of my student survey, where they overwhelmingly state that the new system helped them achieve the course objectives and direct their efforts.)

Second, students who passed this semester do not have any glaring holes in their knowledge and skills. Some are still working through some things, but they are much better prepared for Musicianship III than they were for Theory and Aural Skills II.

Third, students understood the reasonings behind the assignments better (see [survey](/2012/05/student-feedback-on-criterion-referenced-grading/) for data). If I can sell them on the course objectives, and they can see the relationship of the assignments to those objectives, it's easier (if not always _easy_) to sell them on the work. It also keeps me honest as I make assignments!

Fourth, struggling students were both challenged not to let problem areas alone, and encouraged by what they could do well. Several students made comments in the survey along these lines:



> It helped to understand what I was doing well (I used to think I was doing nothing well in aural skills...which can be a bit defeating) and also helped me to understand where I needed to focus my attention.



Fifth, because students who finished well were not penalized for getting material late in the semester, some who were B/C students in the past were motivated to really push ahead and go for full mastery. In one case, a student who just barely passed Theory I and who started off struggling in Theory II finished each unit very strong and ended the semester with a well earned A. I think that's a fairer way to assign final grades, and it motivates a significant number of students to work hard. Few students are ever so far from an A (or from passing) that it's not worth their effort to try for it.

Lastly, this helped students start to take ownership of their education and their development as musicians. Interestingly, the most common critique of the system in the survey is that it let them be lazy. But that's good! Better to learn to overcome that your first year in college than your first year on the job! And seeing how much better the grades were for the class as a whole and for most individuals, it seems that the bulk of those who found themselves prone to laziness this semester learned their lesson before it was too late.



## What needs improvement



First, and most significantly, the system still needs more specificity. Knowing whether one's mastery of voice-leading is passing or failing is more helpful information than a C+ average in the class, or getting Bs or Cs on voice-leading assignments that also include harmonic analysis. However, I can do better in giving them specific guidance through the grades. One mid-semester improvement along these lines was to give a specific list of criteria that would lead to passing grades for the categories that covered our final topical unit (pop/rock music). Next semester, I want to make those specific criteria the new course objectives. I won't have to think "have they demonstrated mastery of law of the shortest way, doublings, chord realization, dissonance resolution, and register on two more more assignments in a row?" before assigning a voice-leading grade. I can simply treat each of those as their own criterion. A good precedent for this kind of system comes from [Andy Rundquist](http://arundquist.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/flipped-sbg-with-voice-so-far/)'s physics courses.

Second, there could be more transparency—or better yet, student ownership—about progress toward the final goal. A few students will read this and think it means "knowing how I'm progressing toward the final grade" or "knowing my current 'average'" (requests from the student survey). This could be clearer, as I was purposefully vague about this early on. However, I really would like to see the students think more in terms of their own musicianship than their grades. This semester moved a lot of them at least a step or two in that direction, but not all the way. I think that a longer list of more specific objectives that they keep track of themselves may help more. 

Still more helpful along these lines would be making the classes pass/fail—especially for the first course or two in the sequence. If there ceases to be differentiation between grades and a significant pull on the GPA (ever present on the minds of scholarship students who don't get straight As and Bs), perhaps the shift from grade goals to musical goals can be made more profoundly.

In a moment of finals-week annoyance I quipped on Twitter, "Can we abolish final letter grades in favor of pass/fail classes and recommendation letters?" The more I think about it, the more I like that idea. As the only teacher most of these students see every day for the first two years of their studies, I end up writing many of them letters anyway. Why can't that be the means of differentiating them, rather than letter grades? Anyway, that's another topic. . . .

Lastly, some re-incorporation of deadlines, at least for first drafts of work, could help a few students stay on track, or at least get started. I like Andy Rundquist's "two-week rule," where students have two weeks after a criterion is "opened" to submit a first attempt. If a student fails to do that, they get 0 for the criterion. If they get it in, they have unlimited redoes to demonstrate mastery by the end of the course. I think some version of that may be helpful to incorporate next time.

All things considered, the new grading system went about as well as I could have hoped. It definitely helped the students accomplish what they needed to accomplish; I don't have any reservations about sending those who passed onto the next level; and those who finished well got high marks. I'll be making some changes for its implementation next year, but I'm definitely not going back.
