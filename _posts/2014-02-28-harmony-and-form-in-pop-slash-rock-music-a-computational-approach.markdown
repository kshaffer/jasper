I'm excited about a new course that I'm slated to teach this Maymester (pending a final approval from my dean—it's passed all the other bureaucracy and is on the summer course calendar). It is a project-based course that will use computational tools to study how pop/rock music is put together. It will also be a hybrid (in-person and online) course that involves collaborating on a project that lives online—a project that will outlive the class and hopefully involve people from outside CU. It will be cross-listed between music and computer science, and offered to both graduate and undergraduate students.

I'm starting to get inquiries from students interested in the course, so I thought I would describe it here. Those interested in taking it can find more info here than in the catalog. And those interested in joining the project before/after/during the course will also find preliminary information here about the project (with more detail coming in future posts). 

*Prospective students, please note that the information below is subject to change as more detailed plans are made in advance of the class.*

# Overview #

*Harmony and Form in Pop/Rock Music* is a hybrid (in-person and online), interdisciplinary, project-based course. The course centers around a corpus study: an analysis of a large collection of pop/rock songs simultaneously. That study explores harmonic and formal structures in pop/rock music of the late 20th and early 21st centuries and provides supporting instruction in identifying harmonic and formal structures by ear, representing those structures using the standard symbols and terms of music theory, encoding those structures digitally, performing computational analysis of those digitally encoded structures, and using digital tools for online collaboration. The course project will be a single collaborative project, though individual students or small groups of students may work on sub-projects. Students will contribute to an existing, open project (which I am currently forming in collaboration with researchers outside CU, including Duke University, the University of Miami, and the University of Virginia) and build on work already done in the field of computational musicology.

The course will focus on the following five conceptual areas:

* Musical theories of harmony and form  
* Recognition of musical structures by ear (transcription/analysis of recordings)  
* Computational analysis/digital humanities research methods  
* Online research collaboration  
* Writing about music (for a popular audience)

# The research project #

The specific project this course will engage is one which I am currently building in collaboration with researchers outside CU. The project involves the creation of a giant corpus of pop/rock songs, analyzed for their harmonic and/or formal content, using existing, publicly available corpora as the starting point. All students in the course will gain experience transcribing the harmonic and formal structures of songs, and music students will be able to bring their expertise to ensuring the corpus contains a large volume of accurate transcriptions.

The project also involves the curation and creation of a collection of software applications and scripts for the computational analysis of the songs in the corpus. Currently existing scripts involve transitional probability and cluster analysis—looking at harmonic progressions, formal functional progressions, and the relationship between the two. Students from computer science and related fields will be able to bring their expertise to improving, integrating, and extending these scripts.

The goal of the collaborative student project is the creation of an ebook or website, aimed at a popular audience, explaining significant aspects of the harmonic and formal structures of modern, Western popular music. Thus, students will also be involved in the creation of a collection of open-access writings explaining and interpreting the findings of the computational analysis project.

# Credit and assessment #

This course will be offered for credit to both undergraduate and graduate students at CU–Boulder. Because the course project is at the intersection of a number of different, but related, fields of study, assessment of student work will use *contract grading*, tailored to individual students' levels (undergraduate or graduate) and disciplines.

To earn a C in the course, all students will be required to perform the same core work. This core will involve engagement with each of the above five conceptual areas, and students must demonstrate some basic working knowledge/skills in each area to earn the C.

Students who wish to earn a higher grade in the course will propose a course contract approximately one-third of the way through the course. This contract will articulate the grade desired and layout a work plan that is appropriate for their interests, field, level (grad/undergrad), and desired grade. That work should demonstrate substantial mastery over two or more of the five conceptual areas to merit the higher grade. Once approved by the instructor, these contracts will bind students to the work laid out. However, amendments to the contracts, if necessary, can be requested in writing well in advance of the relevant course deadlines. Students who fail to meet the requirements of their contract will receive a C if core requirements are met, or a D or F, if core requirements are not met. Students who meet the requirements of their contract will receive the grade listed on the contract.

Sample contracts will be distributed to students—an undergraduate and a graduate version for each field represented in the makeup of the class. Students will be allowed to choose one of the sample contracts, or propose their own contract that is tailored more specifically to their background skills and/or research interests.

# Before and after the course #

Because this course will involve joining an existing research project, the start and end dates for the course need not constrain the research. Students introduced to the project are able, and encouraged, to continue their participation in the research project after the end of the course, as well as to continue to develop the collaborative relationships formed during the course. Also, since this is an existing, continuous project, interested individuals not taking the course can participate in the project, giving CU students an opportunity to collaborate with professional (and amateur) researchers outside the university. Only registered students will be admitted to class meetings and receive formal feedback from the instructor.
