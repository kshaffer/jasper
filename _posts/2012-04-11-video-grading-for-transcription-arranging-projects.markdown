I'm really enjoying using [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) to make screencasts as I walk through student transcription and arranging projects. I think that video is even more useful of a tool for assessment than it is for generating class resources.

For transcription projects, I have students submit a PDF or a native file from their notation application ([MuseScore](http://www.musescore.org) for most of them) on the course website. When I grade, if there are only a couple small errors I either just email them or record a video of me pointing at things with the mouse and telling them what needs to be revisited. If there more than a couple small errors, I may load up the audio track in iTunes and alternate talking and pointing with playing the audio for them explaining what's wrong. (Camtasia has a plugin called Soundflower that allows recording of both a mic and system audio, including MIDI—though that takes a little setup—simultaneously.)

For arrangements, I really like going through the music notation file on video, since I can not only point to good/bad things, but I can change the notes and move voices around in the software while they watch, and then use MIDI playback to demonstrate the difference between what they produced and what I suggest.

I'd love to post a sample video of me grading, but the students' names are on the files, and I usually address them personally at the beginning. Maybe I'll make a fake one sometime for an example for those interested.

So far, the response has been positive. The students claim to understand my comments better, and when they submit redoes, the quality difference between first and second attempts seems to be bigger than when I provided only written comments.

I can imagine the big question, though, is how long this takes. I've found that the grading itself takes less time—or maybe the same amount of time, but I can communicate more or better during that time. And on campus, where we have fast upload (though slow download), putting these videos online doesn't take any longer than it does to give the next assignment a quick look-over before making the next video. (I use Screencast.com, the site that TechSmith, Camtasia's creators, have for hosting videos uploaded directly from Camtasia, and which supports private, authenticated folders perfect for maintaining student privacy) However, if I do this at home (fast download, slow upload), there is a good time gap in between. If I have written quizzes or dictation assignments to grade in between, that's fine. But if all I'm doing is video grading, that's annoying. I've tried to do my grading on campus, then, and if there's work that needs doing while at home, it can be something for which location doesn't matter. Next year, though, I'm thinking about using DropBox instead of Screencast.com for several reasons, and that will make it easier to do all the video making at once, and all the uploading at once (while watching Netflix, perhaps?). So overall, I think this is a net time-saver, and at worst a net time-maintainer. But the increase in quality of communication with the students and their ability to understand and apply my comments is a big plus. It's definitely something I'll continue to do, and hopefully it will allow me to include more model composition and more substantial arranging and transcription projects in the future.

Camtasia comes with a 30-day free trial, so if you're at all intrigued by the idea, try it out.
