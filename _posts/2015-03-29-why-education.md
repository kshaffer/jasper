I've been thinking a lot lately about the purpose(s) of formal education, especially public education. It's not that I haven't thought about it before! But because of some writing projects, and some committee work at CU, I want to articulate an exhaustive, concise vision of the purpose of education.

I've come up with five overarching purposes of formal public education:

- Intellectual and cognitive formation  
- Social formation  
- Critically minded agency  
- Social mobility  
- Workforce preparation  

(Yes, I do think that workforce preparation should be part of the purpose of formal schooling. But I did list it last for a reason.)

What do I have wrong? What am I missing? And should every stage/aspect of education address all five? (I don't think so.)
