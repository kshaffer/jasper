Many teachers and professors have been talking on Twitter about how they can work into their fall classes a discussion of Mike Brown and the events in Ferguson, Mo., after his shooting at the hands of the police. Some are using the hashtag [#FergusonSyllabus](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FergusonSyllabus) to share ideas for assignments and discussion topics.

My first reaction is, "I want to do this!" These are important matters for students to engage, and as an educator (and recent convert to critical pedagogy) I want to help them work through these events intellectually—even personally and socially. I've also done similar things in the past, such as joining the internet blackout in protest of SOPA/PIPA by skipping class activities to discuss the implications of those bills for my music students. However, the events in Ferguson these last two weeks don't "fit" into every course, and it's hard to work discussions of current events into a first-semester music theory class, for example. 

But we teachers don't have to work Ferguson into our course content in order to frame our teaching in light of the social justice concerns that have been brought to the fore this week. That's because Ferguson itself isn't the issue. And discussing Ferguson after the fact can only do so much. We don't just need students who know about Ferguson and can respond to it rightly. We need students who know how to stand up for what is right the *next* time this happens. Even more important, we need to fill our society with the kind of people who will see to it that it doesn't happen again.

We need people in our society who understand the deep-rooted, systemic problems of racism and of police militarization in our country. We need people who know how to question and critique the claims that are given to them. We need people who, when they discover that a "fact" isn't the (whole) truth, know how to go about filtering through the bias and the bull to get at the truth. We need people who are willing to explore the virtues of views held by those outside their political party. We need people who are willing to question illegal orders, instead of blindly following them. We need people who are willing to weigh things carefully when the law and their consciences conflict. More importantly, we need people who are *equipped* to weigh things carefully when law and conscience conflict. And, most of all, we need *people who value every human life*.

These things are bigger than Ferguson. Building a society filled with critically minded citizens, who have the courage of both their convictions and their questions, should be the fundamental task of education. And this can, and should, happen across the curriculum, whether or not a "#FergusonSyllabus" will fit.

Unfortunately, even as critical thinking receives increasing lip service in education, there is still a fetishization of the answer in most American pedagogy. We teachers can't sit on "the answer" for very long, and many of our students are just waiting for us to say it so that they can write it in their notebooks. Too often, education is primarily comprised of this attitude of *tell me the answer, tell me what to do, I'll do it, then give me the grade.* That pattern doesn't prompt people to question. It reinforces the idea that the answer is known, the person in charge is the one who knows, and our bread and butter come from listening to them.

If we want a society that realizes that some questions haven't been answered, that the person in charge is *not* the only expert, and that sometimes justice and our orders are in conflict, school needs to train people for that society—to *be* that society. We need to be willing to ask our students questions that do not have just one answer. We need to be willing to ask our students questions to which the answer is still unknown. And we as teachers need to be willing to *explicitly* put ourselves in positions in front of our students where we are *not* the expert, so that we can help them learn how to work through that kind of a situation productively. 

We can assume that our students will have access to more answers than they can remember in their lives. Let's make sure that we teach them how to question. Then, just maybe, someone next time around will say, "Wait. Is this what we really should be doing?"
