First, thanks to all who have responded to my posts on criterion-referenced grading here on the blog, on twitter, or on the SMT list. It's definitely helpful for me as I'm trying to improve the model for next year's classes. I'm also encouraged that this discussion has led some to consider using some form of criterion-referenced grading in their teaching as well. Though there are kinks to work out of any system, and though different systems are better suited to different student and instructor types, I think that criterion-referenced grading has a lot to offer college-level music instructors.

As the discussion moved forward, I realized that I and others were contrasting criterion-referenced grading with average-based grading, focusing primarily on the difference in the way final grades are calculated. However, there is more to criterion-referenced grading than requiring a list of criteria be met to pass a course, and requiring proficiency across multiple categories to pass a course can take place with in an average-based system as well.

So in this post, I want to clear up something that I have left foggy so far. Namely, criterion-referenced grading is not a monolithic concept. Generally speaking, there are three kinds of grading that are frequently referred to as "criterion-referenced." All three characterize what I do at CSU, and at least one describes what most musicianship instructors do.

The first and most common type of criterion-referenced grading means that students are evaluated on assignments, tests, and the like in reference to an established standard. The alternative would be a curve-based system, where students are evaluated in reference to each other. In a purely curve-based system, the approximate number of students who will receive A, B, C, D, and F are set in advance. That means that some students will always fail, but it also protects against grade inflation (passing students that aren't up to snuff). A criterion-referenced or standards-based system allows for the possibility of all students passing or all students failing, but makes it harder to protect against grade inflation or inconsistent grading across instructors and semesters unless very specific criteria are established. Since on the criteriaâ€“curve spectrum most music theory and aural skills courses already sit pretty far toward the criteria end, and since I think that's appropriate, I won't say any more about that distinction.

The second way in which the term criterion-referenced grading is typically used means that specific assignments are evaluated against multiple criteria or standards or in light of several categories of study. The alternative would be _holistic_ grading, where each assignment gets a single grade reflecting overall satisfaction of the assignment requirements. Here, most musicianship instructors tend toward holistic grading but provide comments according to multiple criteria for competency on a given assignment. 

It seems from the discussions I've had recently that there is a lot of openness to this kind of criterion-referenced evaluation. And I should note that while I don't use the multiple scores such a system gives me to calculate _averages_ for each category at the end of the term, it is possible. In fact, I would advocate that instructors who see a value in average-based (or weighted-average-based) grading would consider abandoning holistic assignment grading in favor of evaluating each assignment in light of multiple grading criteria. (I'll try to put together another post soon with details about what that might look like.)

I have already discussed some of the advantages of grading assignments in light of several criteria rather than with a holistic evaluation, but let me offer a very brief summary of the advantages:




  * Students get clear feedback quickly about what they have mastered and what requires work.  
  * I have quick, easy access to information about what individual students and the class as a whole have mastered and what needs to be addressed in class or individual meetings.  
  * As a result, it is easier to know by looking at my gradebook who is ready for the next course in the sequence and who is not.  
  * And thus, achieving a passing grade in one level of the course sequence is much more in line with preparedness for the next course in the sequence.



Lastly, the term criterion-referenced grading is often used to describe a system where multiple overall criteria must be met to achieve a certain final grade in a course. The alternative would be a (weighted) average-based system, where individual grades are averaged to come to a final grade. (And there are, of course, many ways to calculate that final average.) The advantages of a criterion-referenced system in this regard are, first, that students' competence in one or more area(s) does not mask deficiencies in other areas and, second, that students who master the material by the end of the term are not penalized by achieving that mastery later than their classmates. The advantage of average-based grading, as several have pointed out in discussions here and on the SMT list, is that it motivates students to make a concerted effort on _every_ assignment, which makes it more likely that they will ultimately learn the material well.

This is the point where there has been the most debate. I will say that last semester at CSU, I used a traditional holistic/weighted-average system and saw more zeroes that I've ever seen in my life. Those who are struggling to get all their work in this semester are the same ones who had trouble last semester in the traditional grading scheme. On the other side of things, students who did so well on homework in the holistic/average-based system that they could skip the final and pass the class (or get a 50% on the final and get an A for the semester) and knew it, still studied for the final and earned a high grade. In other words, my lazy students at CSU have been lazy in both systems, and my diligent students have been diligent in both systems. That may not be the case everywhere, but it has led me to look to things other than the method of calculating the final grade to try and motivate the lazy students to engage the material more fully. (I'll probably write about that here later, as well.)

I've already written about the positive effects of calculating the final grade in reference to criteria rather than by averaging the semester's work. However, let me reiterate that it is entirely possible to do away with holistic assignment grading in favor of criterion-referenced marks without abandoning the average-based system for calculating final grades. It is also possible to calculate a final grade according to criteria for early semesters in the theory sequence (where scales and key signatures must be known 100%, not 60% or 70%, and where students come in with diverse levels or pre-existing knowledge) and calculate based on average later in the sequence where are assignments are more diverse, more complex, and grading more subjective.

I hope this post helps clear up some things I didn't explain fully in previous posts. I also hope it helps focus discussion and thinking about these issues in helpful ways.
