I am conducting a crowdfunding campaign to build an **open-source, interactive music theory textbook** that is easy for instructors to use, customize, and augment with their own resources. This will be published by [Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing](http://www.hybridpedagogy.org/#publishing) and built on the [Trinket](http://trinket.io) platform. (Trinket is also a major donor, ***matching dollar-for-dollar the first $2500 of donations from the community***.) For details or to make a contribution, watch the video below and visit [the crowdfunding project page](http://igg.me/at/opentextbook) before July 6.

Why would I create an open-source textbook? One that anyone can access, copy, supplement, or tweak with a few clicks? Following are a few reasons why I want to build an open-source, online "text" "book."

Traditional textbooks are expensive; the open music theory textbook will be **free**.

Traditional textbooks are heavy and easy to forget; the open music theory textbook will be **fully compatible with mobile devices** and accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

Traditional textbooks cannot be edited by the instructor when errors are found, theories invented, or new facts discovered; the open music theory textbook will **allow instructors to update their class resources immediately** when changes need to be made.
Traditional textbooks are based around print, with audio, video, and interactive elements requiring access to a (typically closed) companion website; the open music theory textbook will be **fully multimedia *and* open-access.**

Traditional textbooks teach all students the same way; the open music theory textbook will allow instructors to **customize resources** for their course goals, and even offer **multiple resources** on the same topic to accommodate differences in student backgrounds, goals, preferences, and (dis)abilities.

Traditional textbooks assume a lecture-based course; the open music theory textbook will contain resources that support **inverted/flipped and inquiry-driven courses,** as well.

Traditional textbooks are formidable tomes that generate the impression that building one's own course resources is not for everyone; the open music theory textbook will give instructors an **easy** starting point for creating **customized and tailored resources** for their students.

Those are just a few of the reasons why we're working on an open-source textbook for music theory. If these sound valuable for teachers and students, please join us by [donating and spreading the word](http://igg.me/at/opentextbook) before July 6. Thanks!
