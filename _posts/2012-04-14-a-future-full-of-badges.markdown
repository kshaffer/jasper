UC-Davis has created a new system of academic credentials known as "badges," which Kevin Carey explains at [The Chronicle of Higher Education](http://chronicle.com/article/A-Future-Full-of-Badges/131455/?sid=wc&utm_source=wc&utm_medium=en). These badges, not unlike the Boy and Girl Scouts' merit badges, provide detailed information about a person's skills and knowledge in specific areas. This contrasts the traditional academic transcript in two chief ways. First, the skill information is more specific than a letter grade in a particular course (which could cover any number of topics; and as I've discussed previously in this blog, the course may have a grading system that masks serious gaps in student understanding when averaged with other topics in the same course on which they excel). Second, badges are open and reflect knowledge obtained anywhere, rather than knowledge gained at a single institution.

UC-Davis are not unique in using badges. Carey notes the work that the Mozilla Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation have put toward supporting the creation of such systems. And, of course, Khan Academy uses a badge system to reflect knowledge gained on the site.

The badge system has some clear points in its favor. For one, it is similar to a [criterion-referenced or standards-based grading](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/wordpress/tag/criterion-referenced-grading/) system in that it diminishes the likelihood of student weaknesses being "averaged out." It also allows for individual-paced learning and the possibility of full-time employees knocking off some basic "coursework" on their own pace on nights and weekends (or on the job, for that matter) before jumping into full- or part-time university study to tackle what can't be done readily on one's own.

And there are some clear kinks to be worked out. For instance, will there be one central body determining the criteria for badge awarding? Will instructors need to be certified? Will each field have their own? Or will there be competing certification/accreditation boards? And as one commenter on Carey's article asked, how long will these badges last? A degree from Yale has pretty long lasting significance (at least, that's what I'm banking on!). Will these badges just disappear in a few years?

Rather than jump whole hog into that debate, I want to direct my thoughts toward a particular issue that Carey brought up:



> _Compared with the new open badge systems, the standard college transcript looks like a sad and archaic thing. Its considerable value is not based on the information it provides, which is paltry. What does a letter grade in a course often described only by the combination of a generic department label and an arbitrary number (e.g. Econ 302) really mean? Nobody knows, which is why_ accredited colleges often don't trust that information for the purposes of credit transfer, even when it comes from other accredited colleges. [emphasis added]



This is a real problem. I've had several students this year come in with AP Music Theory credits or transfer credits and were placed into the level where they left off in their previous study. All of them were missing some important skill or piece of knowledge that my class covered the previous semester. Now, some of them rose to the challenge and have done brilliantly. But some have not. And it's not entirely their fault. If CSU had better information about their background (or a better policy for acting on that information), we could place them better. It need not mean taking an extra prerequisite course; it may simply mean knowing ahead of time that they need to read up on _x_ or practice doing _y_ over the semester break, or audit the last few weeks of the previous course, before jumping in. But if we don't know there's a disconnect, they certainly won't.

However, I'm not convinced that badges are the way to solve this problem. Instead, professors and universities can simply be more careful about testing incoming students before placing them, perhaps even granting them credit for courses where they have already mastered the material outside of an accredited course. 

That's the change we made at CSU to work around our AP and transfer problem. Starting next year, we will require a placement exam of anyone bringing in music theory/aural skills/musicianship credits. If they demonstrate knowledge and mastery consistent with the course objectives of Musicianship II, they are placed in Musicianship III (whether they took one semester or four prior to transfer). Looking at a letter grade, a course description (which probably isn't up-to-date), and an institution's reputation isn't enough to tell us if a student will succeed at level _x_. So we'll test them ourselves and put them where we think they best belong, regardless of how many credits they have. (Our registrar counts them as general credits until they pass our placement test or take our course in its place.)

Of course, you may say that evaluating students against a list of course objectives for each level of study is basically what UC-Davis's badges do. And I'd agree. However, there is a movement to make badges universal, and that's where I see the problem. As Carey writes:



> _The top-flight educators at UC-Davis may develop the first widely used badge system for sustainable agriculture, but they won't, in the long run, control it. Over time, farmers, students, civic groups, companies, professional organizations, and individual scholars will all contribute to a continuing process of helping people organize critical information about their lives._



I love the idea of a degree or a transcript saying (in a fair amount of detail), _the faculty at this institution agree that this graduate/student knows this material and possesses these skills at this level_ rather than a list of grades for a list of cryptically titled classes (which cover different material every year). But I cringe at the idea of a single list of badges (whether controlled by a central authority or an "open" "community") and what it will do for employment practices and curriculum design, not to mention the increase in "grade grubbing" ("badge grubbing"?) it is sure to bring. Like a Windows software update, I'm afraid that an open, standardized badge system would introduce more problems than it fixes.

All in all, I think the answer to discrepancy between institutions and the opportunities for individuals to learn outside university is not to create a national or international standard metric of achievement. Rather, each individual institution—whose faculty know the curriculum and the current students, have a particular vision for the outcome of the students' education, and _who will be personally investing themselves in these new students' lives and scholarly development for the next few years_—should take care to assess incoming and outgoing students in the most meaningful ways, in the best service of their education. Invested faculty with clear goals, keen awareness of student progress, and a willingness to adjust methods (and institutional policies) in service of bringing those students to those goals will always beat a standardized system. I applaud UC-Davis for seeking clarity, transparency, and specificity in the way they assess students, and for their willingness to redesign the curriculum from the ground up around a department consensus of knowledge and skills necessary for graduates of their program. But I shudder at the thought of making a single, universal [map of knowledge](http://www.khanacademy.org/exercisedashboard).
