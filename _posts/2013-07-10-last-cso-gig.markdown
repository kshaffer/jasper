And while I'm sharing pictures, here are some professional shots of Colleen and me playing third and fourth horn with the Charleston Symphony a few weeks ago. We performed outdoors, in front of the steps to the US Customs House in Charleston at dusk, to kick off the Piccolo Spoleto Festival. It was our last performance with the Symphony before moving to Colorado.
