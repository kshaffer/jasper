*A lot happened in 2014, and a lot was written about it. Here are the highlights from my work and, far more substantially, the work of others whom I admire.*

## My work

My most-read article of 2014: [An Open Letter to My Students](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/open-letter-students/)

My favorite article of 2014 (I think): [Three Lines of Resistance: Ethics, Critical Pedagogy, and Teaching Underground](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/three-lines-resistance-ethics-critical-pedagogy-teaching-underground/)

My most-read blog post of 2014: [What is music theory?](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/02/what-is-music-theory/)

My favorite blog post of 2014 (I think — it certainly has the best picture!): [Education and discipline](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/09/education-and-discipline/)

And, of course, there's [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com)

I'm sure I'm missing some wonderful things. Apologies to authors whose work I missed — or didn't even get to read in the first place! (My Instapaper queue is still pretty long from last year, after all.) But come follow these authors, and me, on Twitter, and you'll catch plenty to keep you busy in 2015.
