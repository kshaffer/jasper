I want to write a book about education. The focus will primarily be on making a case against a number of industrial-era educational practices that still persist in the U.S. today — things like letter and percentage grades, standardized tests, grade levels, semester schedules, etc. Throughout the course of this critique, I'll layout the implicit ideology that underlies these practices. The end of the book will then layout a different ideology, one centered in student agency and critical pedagogy, and suggest some small and big ways in which we can improve education in light of that ideology.

I'm excited about this project, as it will be a valuable research endeavor for me, and I think it could be a help to a lot of educators, students, and parents.

There are a few things I'm mulling over before I dive into the research and writing, though. And I'm hoping that some of you can help me work through these decisions I have to make.

First, where to pursue publication? One option is to pursue a contract with a trade publisher, possibly through an agent. Trade publishers can be valuable in helping a book reach a much wider audience than academic presses and self-publishers are typically able to. Since I plan on addressing issues in a variety of disciplines, in both K–12 and post-secondary environments, I want to make sure the book has the potential to reach people throughout those areas. I think that a trade publisher with a solid marketing department may do that best. Also, this book will be a lot of work, and my current faculty position doesn't financially compensate research time. A trade publisher would provide the best chance of being compensated for the time that would go into the research and writing.

Using a trade publisher comes with some drawbacks, though. For one, it undercuts my usual preference for open-access. Compared with for-profit journal and textbook publishers, though, trade publishers are far less predatory in their practices, and the books are pretty affordable. So this isn't as big an issue for me as when a journal company makes a huge profit off of unethical sales practices and shares none of it with the author. Perhaps more potentially difficult for me is that trade publishers tend not to publish a book containing a large percentage of material already published elsewhere. I don't like to sit on things very long once I've written them! And while I might find ways to publish articles here and there on the same topics that are different enough, the idea of sitting on a lot of this material before it gets out into the world (and before I get paid for it) is pretty dissonant with the way I normally work. And, of course, there are issues of transfer of copyright that I would need to be careful about.

There are viable options beyond using a trade publisher, which open up other questions about formatting and writing process. For example, if I decided to self-publish (or go through *Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing*, which Robin Wharton and I are working to get fully off the ground), I could blog and publish more freely as I work, allowing a community to offer feedback along the way. And I could get paid for some of the articles I publish (like my recent piece in [*Engaging Modern Learners*](http://modernlearners.com/sustainable-pedagogy), which will be dis-embargoed in a couple months). Those articles could help build an audience in advance of the book. (This is something I'd want to do anyway, but I wouldn't have to worry about content duplication in the same way as through a trade publisher.) I could then publish the final version as an ebook for sale, with a print-on-demand option. This would be a much more comfortable option for me, given how I normally work. But would a self-published work have the same reach? And would the money made from the freelance articles and the sales of the completed book offer sufficient financial compensation? I simply don't know. (I'm not being greedy about the money here. I simply need to make more than my current base salary covers, and devoting time to writing a book would take away time from teaching summer and overload courses, gigs, or working on other freelance projects.)

I also am mulling over possible titles. I'd like to get an almost-settled working title early, so that I can tweet and blog things with the title (or a derived hashtag) in it. That will help build publicity, but also provide for easy searches about the project, throughout the process and once the book is finished. Here are some options so far:

- *Sustainable School: The Case Against the Factory Model of American Education* (hashtag: #SustainableSchool)  
- *Unsustainable: The Fallacies and Falsehoods Behind American Educational Practices* (hashtag: #unsustainable)  
- *Resist: Moving Beyond the Factory Model of American Education* (hashtag: #resist)

I'd love to hear feedback from you all on any of these questions. Where to publish? What format should the book take? How (much) should I publish along the way? Which of these (or other) titles do you like? This coming semester will allow me a good bit of time to get working on the book, on related articles, or both. So what do you think?
