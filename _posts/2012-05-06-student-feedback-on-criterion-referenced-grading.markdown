At the end of this semester, I asked my students to fill out a few short surveys about some of the changes I introduced this semester, and some of the resources we made use of this year. One of those surveys was on the change from a holistic, average-based grading system to a criterion-referenced grading system. Just under half of my students who finished courses with me this semester responded (a few more than filled out CSU course evaluations!). Here are the questions and responses.



#### 1. Did the new grading system help you achieve the course objectives better?

#### 2. How did the new grading system help guide your study and direct your efforts towards achieving the course objectives throughout the semester?

#### 3. How did the new grading system help guide your efforts *at the end of the semester*?

#### 4. How did having multiple scores per assignment affect your ability to achieve the course objectives?

#### 5. Did the new grading system make more apparent the reasoning behind the assignments given?

#### 6. How did the absence of late penalties for assignments affect your coursework? (did you do less work or the same work? was it freeing? or did it make it easier for you to fall behind?)





> i still did the same work





> It was very freeing. I felt like I could do more work done than I could before because I had more time.





> It definitely made it easier to fall behind but that was my own fault. Although it was easier to fall behind, it was very freeing. I liked that I could turn things in and catch up.





> I did less work, so it was freeing, but it also made it easy to get lazy and fall behind.





> It was definitely freeing, because there was one time that i just had so much music to be learning and work in other classes that i was able to hold off on the theory assignment and finish it later, but still be evaluated on my knowledge of the assignment





> I did the same amount of work and tried to submit everything in a timely manner.





> I thought it was great because it allowed you to take your time to make sure assignments were correct instead of rushing to get stuff done. It helped balance the amount of coursework as a music major. Thank you!





> It did not affect my work. I may have been less worried about getting it in by 9:00 am, but I didn't miss any assignments at all. This system made me feel like I needed to do all the work to grasp the concepts...I felt like it was freeing (see above and the part about aural skills creating an abundance of anxiety for me in previous semesters)





> It was nice knowing that, after several hours of homework, I could go to bed without stressing about that one extra Theory or Aural Skills assignment.





#### 7. How did the ability to resubmit assignments affect your ability to achieve the course objectives?

#### 8. What would you suggest that I do in future semesters?



[![](/uploads/2012/05/gradingQ8.png)](/uploads/2012/05/gradingQ8.png)

Obviously, the students liked the new system. In fact, some of them liked it so much that they don't want me to improve it! (question 8) It took some of them some getting used to. However, no one wants to go back to the old system. And they believe (as do I) that the criterion-referenced system helped guide their efforts more than the old traditional system—and take more ownership of their education. Most of all, the ability to _resubmit_ assignments was universally appreciated. And, as my [previous post](/2012/05/data-on-student-engagement-with-criterion-referenced-grading/) demonstrated, it seems to contribute more significantly to overall student improvement than simply doing more new assignments.

I do have some improvements that I want to make, which I'll discuss in future posts, and at that point I'll discuss some of the written comments provided by students in response to these questions. However, given student performance this semester and student response to the new system, I'm definitely not going back to the old system of holistic, average-based grading. And I strongly encourage any instructors who read this to give some form of criterion-referenced grading a try—even just for a single course.
