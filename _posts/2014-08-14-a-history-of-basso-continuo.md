*I am currently editing (and expanding) the voice-leading section in our textbook, Open Music Theory, and I need some help. I'm trying to add a little more context (and answers to "why?") for some of the early stages in the text—particularly the "strict," a-stylstic elements in which students often do not perceive relevance, at least not right away. With that in mind I wrote a brief history of basso-continuo style keyboard writing, which is the basis of the four-voice-leading unit. Since it's been a while since I read about this, and since I'm simplifying the story here, I want to make sure I'm not oversimplifying it or putting forward some factual errors. So I'd love feeback on this part: do I make any mistakes (beyond the necessary simplification for a background reading for first-year theory)? Thanks to any who can help out!*

## A brief history of *basso continuo*

*Basso continuo* (It. for "continuous bass" or "thoroughbass") is essentially a chordal version of first-species counterpoint. However, instead of composing a single line above a cantus firmus, one composes a succession of chords (performed in the right hand) above a bass line (performed in the left hand). *Basso continuo* writing, also referred to as *realizing a figured bass*, gives no consideration to melody, only to the use of proper chords and the smoothest voice-leading possible. Thus, *basso continuo* style is a simple place to begin engaging the "fundamental musical problems" that arise when more than two lines are combined. 

***insert graphic example***

Coming after species counterpoint in our studies, *basso continuo* exercises provide a new, more complicated environment in which to practice mediating the demands of smoothness, independence of lines, tonal fusion (now considering triads and seventh chords), variety, and motion. New considerations of performability are introduced, and the presence of dissonances within the core harmonies themselves will call for new approaches to harmonic dissonance in this style.

### History

*Basso continuo* emerged in the seventeenth century as a shorthand notation for keyboardists (typically church organists) who were accompanying a soloist or small ensemble performing a work originally composed for a larger group. For example, if two or three singers were tasked with performing an eight-voice choral work, they could select the most prominent parts to sing, while an organist could cover the rest. Performing five or six lines of contrapuntal choral music could be a significant challenge, so organists needed a way to condense the texture while still preserving the core musical structure to support the vocalists.

The *thorough bass* emerged as that shortcut. The "thorough" or "continuous" bass is a musical line that includes the lowest note at any given time. Usually, works would not include a single part that could function as this line, so the organist would alternate between voices, as they exchanged registers or took rests. The resulting line, unline the regular "bass" part, was "continuous" (or "thorough")—hence the name *thoroughbass* or *basso continuo*.

A good musician could perform this bass line, and with an eye (or ear) on the vocal parts and with knowledge of how to improvise good voice-leading, that musician could *accompany* the thoroughbass line with chords that made musical sense. (This is the original meaning of the term accompany—to accompany a bass line with chords. The fact that keyboardists did this in the context of supporting a soloist or small ensemble led to that term later being applied to any situation where a keyboardist *accompanied* spotlight performers.)

As this technique grew, publishers began publishing thoroughbass reductions of large-ensemble pieces to support smaller groups of musicians. In these publications, *figures* (numbers above or below the bass line) were included—sometimes only for difficult or non-standard chords, and eventually for most chords, enabling more amateur musicians, as well as students, to make use of the technique. These bass lines with figures became known as "figured bass" lines.

***insert graphic example (facsimile?)***

To this day, harpsichordists performing in Baroque ensembles will often put their left hand to the same "bass" line that the cellos play, and will improvise right-hand chords (with contrapuntally sound embellishment) according to the figures provided with the bass line.

Though most music students are not Baroque keyboard specialists in training, thoroughbass, or *basso continuo*, can be a valuable tool in the study of harmony and voice-leading. In the study of harmony, a thoroughbass line can play a valuable role as a harmonic *reduction* of a complex texture, in order to example and understand better the harmonic skeleton underlying a passage. In aural dictation, transcription, and analysis, the bass line and the melody are often the most prominent (and most important) lines in a passage, and knowing how the inner voices tend to relate to the bass line and melody can aid in a number of listening and aural-analysis tasks. In voice-leading, the *basso continuo* texture affords a straightforward environment in which to make a gradual, staged progression through the intricacies of writing musical lines in a harmonic texture—and to do so without paying significant attention to harmony.

The next section is an introduction to the basic principles of *basso-continuo*-style writing. It starts very simply, and, like species counterpoint, gradually adds complicating elements, with a view towards composing, arranging, analyzing, and understanding tonal music that makes use of fairly complex musical textures.
