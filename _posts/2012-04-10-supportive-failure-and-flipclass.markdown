Last night, I joined in on the #flipclass discussion on Twitter. (I was grading, but I jumped into the discussion a few times while my comment videos were uploading to my students' [Screencast.com](http://www.screencast.com) folders.) This discussion takes place on Mondays at 8pm Eastern, and any who are flipping their class or interested in it can join in. I think most of the others were HS teachers, but what was discussed applies for many pedagogical situations. As you might expect from a chat on Twitter, it was a bit scattershot and fragmented, but there was also some good stuff put forward and links passed around.

One idea that came up a lot was the idea of teaching students that it is okay to fail. ([Stacey Roshan](https://twitter.com/#!/buddyxo) called it "supported failure.") In fact, often it is necessary to try, fail, and learn from one's mistakes. Samuel Beckett said, "Ever tried? Ever failed? No Matter, try again, fail again, fail better." I used to think he was talking about writing a dissertation! But now it's an important message to pass on to all my students.

I found quickly last semester how paralyzing the fear of failure can be for my students. The first time I gave them an exercise in species counterpoint (a centuries-old method of music composition study that strips away most complicating factors to allow the student to focus intently on one or two fundamental musical problems), I fully expected most students to fail to accomplish all that I asked them to do. Thus, I was planning on grading the first one on effort, and following it with two or three more assignments that focus on the same musical issues and maintain the level of difficulty, grading gradually more harshly over the sequence of assignments. However, my students attempted a mutiny! "We're moving too fast!" (It was the first homework assignment after a unit test.) "I don't know how to do this!" (Of course you don't. We just started!) And no matter how many sports metaphors I gave them (You don't learn how to shoot free throws accurately by listening to a coach tell you what to do; you listen and then _practice!_) and how forgivingly I graded early assignments for each new species, I could not assuage their tension, frustration, and paralyzing fear of doing something they don't yet know how to do. (Nor could I get them to look past the grade on top down to the comments that would help them on the next assignment.)

Some of this is No Child Left Behind. They are so focused on getting the grade, and getting it _every single time_ that the idea of doing a homework assignment that they don't already know how to do is frightful, and the idea of receiving comments on an assignment and using them to improve for the next one (or a redo) is foreign to many of them. Some of it was me. I was the new professor, and the only one teaching music theory and aural skills. The previous instructor did not use species counterpoint. And my last teaching gig was as a grad student instructor in an Ivy League university. So it must be me or the material that needed to be fixed. Thankfully, the other faculty in my dept. are great, and they all had my back. We stuck it out, and it was okay. And this semester, my students have been discovering over and over again why we used species counterpoint, and why it was important to get that down before we moved on to other things.

But the big thing here, I think, is that these students are simply afraid to fail. The self-esteem inflation of their early education, the grade-grubbing focus of No Child Left Behind, and the fragile adolescent ego of the young musician all contribute to this. But what to do about it?

As I've experimented with the "flipped"/"inverted" class in music theory this semester (information transfer occurs at home via readings, listenings, and videos; practice exercises, projects, and small-group discussion happen in class), I've found the fear of failure finally starting to disappear.

For example, I introduced my students to voice-leading in pop/rock vocal style (making arrangements of a Christian worship song for a small vocal ensemble). There is no textbook that covers this material, so I wrote up five pages of tips and things to keep in mind, made a 25-minute screencast video of me doing an arrangement of a song in the software they will be using (purposefully making and correcting a few mistakes), and then had them come to class having read and watched, ready to try one of their own. I then gave them a song with a few really tricky passages and had them work on it in partners as I wandered the room listening and helping. 

A couple interesting things _didn't_ happen. First, no one did nothing and said, "I didn't get it." They all did something. Second, no one said, "I missed that day in class, so I don't know what to do" (which, of course, they say even when I all but read the book to them in a lecture). Third, _no one freaked out when I looked over their shoulder and saw mistakes_. It was just understood tacitly that they would try something, it wouldn't work, and they would change it. Perhaps my doing so in the demo contributed to that; perhaps the fact that they were using software that allows them to drag notes around instead of erase and rewrite contributed to that; perhaps the fact that they could complete this assignment in partners and have it count toward their assessment requirements contributed to that. But I definitely think the format was a key factor, since this has happened on several occasions: doing a project in class, especially in groups, with the instructor basically doing "office hours" for everyone at once, sends the message (paraphrasing Beckett) _try, fail, try again, fail better_ . . . and eventually succeed.

Looking back, I didn't really learn how to fail properly (that is, purposefully) in my academic life until I was working on my dissertation. In other words, I had three masters degrees (don't ask, it's actually kind of silly), two from an Ivy League school, before I started to learn how to fail purposefully. You can't succeed at any research project of significance without failing (unless you're _really_ lucky). I wish I had learned it sooner. Thankfully, the sports I played growing up taught me some of that. And interestingly, those sports activities did not result in a grade after every practice—just feedback. Only the major activities (games, meets) had quantifiable results—and the first one only came after a bunch of practices. Maybe we could learn a lesson there. And maybe then our students won't have to get a Ph.D. to learn how to fail.
