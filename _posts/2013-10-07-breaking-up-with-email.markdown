I need to break up with email. Things just aren't working out. Email is whiny, high-maintenance, and gets in the way of too many more important things in my life. We need to break up.

Of course, the thing is, a lot of my friends are friends with email, too. I'm afraid a sudden break up will mean losing some of them. On the other hand, I know a lot of my friends are just as fed up with email as I am. So I'm working on a plan slowly to phase email out of my life. I know a clean break would be better for me personally. But for the sake of others—both those who will need to get used to the idea of me not being in this relationship anymore, and those who also want to break up with email—I will be moving slowly. Since I'm not the only one looking to dump email, I'm hoping that this can be a collaborative effort. 

# Beginning the break-up #

For a while I've used [Gmail Meter](http://gmailmeter.com/) to keep track of my email habits. Though it doesn't apply to my work email (a colorado.edu Exchange account), it's a great tool for beginning this process. Gmail Meter has made it clear to me that the bulk of my non-CU emails come from and go to a very small number of people. They can generally break down as follows: my wife, other family members, current professional projects (a different project each month or two), non-CU professional contacts, church (mainly announcements), and commercial (landlord, repairs, receipts for online orders, coupons, etc.). My CU email is pretty easy to compartmentalize, also: students, departmental faculty, and college/university announcements.

Compartmentalization is the first step to breaking up with email, since I can deal with one or two compartments at a time. It also helps me see how in almost every specific case, email is *not* the optimal solution. For example, many of the emails from my wife are articles she thinks I would enjoy reading, or activities that would be fun for the family. The browser on our home computer has my Instapaper bookmarklet installed, so I could simply ask her to Instapaper those articles (it's easy to delete the one's I'm not actually interested in), and we can create a bookmarks folder or a document shared across devices for links to websites for possible family activities, purchases, etc. These are all better options than email, and just as easy once set up (easier in the case of Instapaper or a bookmarks folder). It just takes a little planning at the outset to set up a flow.

Another example would be collaborative professional projects (such as ebook publishing, article co-authoring, or conference co-presenting). Most of my recent collaborative projects have lived in Google Drive or GitHub. I can simply be proactive about using comments and collaborative to-do lists there—which, again, work much better for organizing a project than email threads, anyway. Similarly, I can also be more strict about having my students use the class discussion forum instead of email when they have non-private questions—which again is better, since the entire class will be able to read the answer to that question about course materials or an upcoming deadline.

The email categories I listed above generally fall into two groups: things that can pretty easily be moved out of email (family, students, collaborative projects, etc.) and things that require email (announcement listserves, random emails from professional colleagues outside CU, etc.). And interestingly, for me the categories that absolutely require email for the time being are all things that don't need daily attention. I see my wife every day, I see my departmental colleagues every weekday (we all have offices in the same hall), etc. So I don't think it would be that hard to get email down to a once-a-week thing. (An auto-reply message informing senders of my once-a-week policy and providing multiple alternate means of contact for time-sensitive issues can catch the few pressing matters that I might otherwise miss.)

I don't think moving to once-a-week cold turkey in the middle of the semester would work, though. So here's my short-term plan:

- Go back to *checking* email, instead of running it in the background. Make it like going to the mailbox: a chore that I must do, but only once (maybe twice) per day.  
- No checking email at all until late morning. *My* to do list determines the things I do in my most productive hours of the day (8–11am), not other people's to-do list for me (which is what email is, after all).  
- Set up email alternatives for the above categories one at a time. Family and students would be an easy place to start. And being proactive in the organizing stages of new collaborative projects would help as well.

Once I have good habits and email alternatives in place, I'll be able to gauge their effectiveness and re-evaluate for the future.

What do you all think? Have any of you ditched email? Do you want to? Have you worked out ways to make it less painful? Do you foresee issues with what I'm planning? I'd love to hear from you in [the comments]({{ root_url }}/2013/10/breaking-up-with-email/#disqus_thread).
