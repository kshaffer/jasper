In support of my last post on criterion-referenced grading in music theory and aural skills courses, I thought I'd provide a list of course objectives that I use as grading criteria for Music Theory II this semester.

Here are the course objectives from my syllabus for Music Theory II (which covers diatonic harmony syntax, keyboard-style voice leading, and an introduction to pop/rock and contemporary Christian worship music).





  * Voice-leading in strict keyboard style  
  * Voice-leading in pop/rock vocal style  
  * Functional bass analysis  
  * Harmonic syntax (analysis and composition)  
  * Formal functions (analysis with and without a score)  
  * Cadences (composition and analysis, with and without a score)  
  * Phrase and theme type identification (with and without a score)  
  * Hermeneutics (classical form)  
  * Pop/rock form type identification (with and without a lead sheet)  
  * Pop/rock harmony  
  * Writing about music  
  * Use of music software (notation and analysis)



As mentioned in my previous post, a student must achieve a passing overall score in each category to pass the class. The overall score for a category does not come from averaging all assignments in a topic. Rather, I assign the final score for the topic based on the mastery of the topic they reflect in their last work on that topic. In some cases, this is a reflection of the general quality of work done in that category: for instance, how many mistakes they make in their assignment of functions, bass scale-degrees, and prolongational annotations to chords in their functional bass analysis. In others, there are specific sub-criteria for the category: for instance, students must be able to typeset a keyboard-style voice-leading assignment with proper stem directions, key signature, time signature, thoroughbass figures, and multi-layer functional bass analysis and then generate a PDF file to receive full marks in "use of music software" (the notation part), and they only need do it once.

Moving forward, I can see a couple needs for improvement, which are going into my planning for future semesters. First, some categories need splitting. For instance, the "cadences" category includes proper voice-leading of simple, compound, and double cadences (using the galant Italian designations); recognizing from an unfigured bass which cadence type should be used; identifying cadences in a keyboard piece by Mozart, Beethoven, or Haydn (PAC, IAC, or HC; simple- or double-cadence pattern on the cadential dominant); and identifying those cadences by ear without a score. I've found that these skills do not all go hand-in-hand. Proper voice-leading of compound cadences, for instance, is completely independent of recognizing PAC, HC, and IAC by ear or by score. As a result, when I assign overall cadence scores, I need to factor in both writing and recognizing cadences, and must assign a failing grade overall if the student has not demonstrated the ability to do both. That's complicated for me as a grader, and not transparent to the students. (Though, when a student is failing one and not the other, voice-leading is almost always the culprit.) Thus, at the very least, cadence voice-leading and cadence analysis need to be separate categories.

I've also found that some categories are superfluous. For instance, while it is important that the students understand formal functions, I test that understanding through their analysis of theme forms. If they can identify themes, phrases, and subphrases properly, they probably understand functions. At least, that's the way I test it. As long as I continue to use the assignments and tests that I do, I don't need formal functions as a grading category.

Lastly, while some of these categories are fairly straightforward in terms of what requires mastery—or are easy to explain in terms of specific criteria—some are still clouded in mystery. What constitutes sufficient working knowledge of keyboard-style voice-leading, for example, needs more specificity. So for next time, I plan on including specific metrics for scores in these categories. For example, I may create a list of things like _produce three voice-leading exercises in a row that are free from illegal parallels_ that all need to be met in order to pass the voice-leading category. This will give the students clear expectations and make it easier for me to remember exactly what they have done and not done when they come to me to discuss progress.

As I continue to refine this, I see the fundamentals/Musicianship I end of the sequence taking on a very detailed checklist (and possibly becoming pass/fail classes), while the Musicianship IV end (at least for the theory and analysis side) will remain broader and more subjective. Thankfully, there are a few English/Writing professors who have published their ideas on evaluating writing in a criterion-referenced model, and I plan on stealing (and linking to) lots of their ideas!
