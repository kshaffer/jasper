Academic assessments always test more than we think.

For example, recent studies have found that timed quizzes in K–12 math classes measure a student's cognitive working memory load, as well as their ability to make basic calculations quickly. Likewise, these timed tests measure a student's level of anxiety—and in many cases, they contribute to it, as well. (See Jo Boaler's ["Research suggests timed tests cause math anxiety"](http://newsroom.unl.edu/announce/csmce/3499/18149) for more information on these and other studies.)

We use the same kind of timed quizzes in music theory courses to assess student fluency in fundamental concepts of notation and structure. And though no studies have been done (to my knowledge), I suspect that my timed quizzes have some of the same negative effects. In fact, I'm positive that they do for at least some of my students.

So can we do it differently? Can we accomplish the same pedagogical goals without timed quizzes?

I think so. In fact, I think we can do it better.

My pedagogical goal for these fundamentals (scales, key signatures, chords, meter, rhythm, etc.) is to help my students achieve fluency in these concepts before they move on to higher-level musical tasks like composing analyzing music that uses these basic structures. And by fluency, I mean that the basic "vocabulary" and "grammar" for these elements are stored in students' long-term memory, at a high enough level of pre-activation and with enough connections with other musical concepts and atcitivies that they are recognized immediately in context, or recalled with minimal effort.

I use timed quizzes (usually giving students 3–4 times the amount of time it takes me to perform the same task) to assess students' ability to recognize or quickly recall these basic elements in context, as well as to motivate students to spend out-of-class time working on memorization. That way, class time can be devoted to more interesting, and more complex things.

But there's a problem. Just as in math, timed quizzes cause anxiety. Even though my students can take them multiple times until they pass (90% accuracy in the time given) with impunity, even though they are open-note, there is a ["habit field"](http://alistapart.com/article/habit-fields) surrounding these tests (HT: [Andrew Crust](https://twitter.com/andrewjcrust)). For some students, these tests bring with them memories of past success in high-stakes testing environments. But increasingly, anything that looks like a high-stakes, high-pressure academic test brings with it negative emotional memories from students' past. So even if the concept and grading scheme are not particularly anxiety-producing in and of themselves, the timed quiz may elicit anxiety because of these memories, the timed-quiz "habit field."

Perhaps more importantly, we tend to begin a two-year sequence of courses in music theory with several weeks of regularly scheduled timed quizzes. In my case, the beginning of every class meeting. These quizzes set the tone for the whole course sequence. Instead of preparing students for two years of exploration, inquiry, and stimulating challenges, these quizzes generate an expectation that music theory is about intellectual performance and the regurgitation of known answers. 

So how can we promote, and assess, fluency with these basic musical concepts without resurrecting students' anxiety-producing "habit fields"? And more importantly, can we promote fluency in a way that also sets the tone for high-level, critical inquiry in our subsequent studies of musical structure?

I'm still thinking this through. However, I have a few ideas—things I might try this semester, others that I'll think about before my next time teaching first-semester theory.

My first thought is that we could replace memorization tasks as the main vehicle for building fluency. Unconscious recognition and/or fast recall are facilitated by having these musical elements at a high state of neural activation, with strong neural connections to as many other potential "cues" as possible. This makes it easy for a variety of contextual clues to bring the target concept to consciousness, allowing working memory to make use of it in the task at hand. Memorization drills can facilitate the pre-activation levels of these concepts in long-term memory, but they build only limited associations. Further, memorization drills *without instant feedback* can lead to incorrect associations being formed in memory, which need to be unlearned before future re-learning can happen.

One way to build stronger and more plentiful associations while providing instant feedback is to use multimodal musical activity. Having students sing, play an instrument, look at a keyboard, look at (or write) staff notation, etc. simultaneously both builds associations and offers plentiful opportunity for correction when one mode is incorrect. That is, if a student sings and plays different pitches, they discover this immediately, and can take corrective action. But this is not possible in the facilities and course arrangements in which some of us teach music theory. Most of us would love to teach "written," "aural," and keyboard-based theory in one course, with small groups of students sitting in front of keyboards and computers. But most of us don't have that option.

Alternatively, we could address these nots-and-bolts concepts with critical questions. We can ask students to explain verbally the logic behind certain musical conventions. Why are the sharps in key signatures ordered F–C–G–D–A–E–B? Why are the flats the reverse of this? Why are there three different kinds of minor scales, but pieces are never called Sonata in D Harmonic Minor? Why do we count both starting and ending pitches when enumerating diatonic intervals (C–E is a third, not a second), but not when counting chromatic intervals (C–E is 4 half-steps not 5)? I think that pursuing answers to questions like these will still require students to learn the nuts and bolts, but will ask them to think less automatically and more critically about them. These questions tie notational convention to historical accidents and instrumental idiosyncrasies. And in many ways, fulfilling a course objective like "Explain why chord inversions are different from flipping the chord upside-down" is more difficult than "Correctly identify and write major, minor, augmented, and diminished triads in all inversions on a fast-paced timed quiz." 

Another possible approach could be to ask students, after taking a (timed) quiz perhaps, to identify specific areas that are difficult for them. The Western musical notation system is a syncretic mix of elements with bases in different ways of thinking about the world, many of which have passed their expiration date (compound meter time signatures, for example). Some aspects of Western notation are discriminatory against people with certain cognitive differences or disabilities. We could ask students to identify the specific elements that cause them the most confusion, and then construct a logical (if not 21st-century) explanation for the system—or propose an alternative system! Again, this would be harder than simply drilling, but would lead to a deeper understanding of the concept, open up the possibility of questioning convention, and would allow some students to find a new route around a mental block that is making traditional drilling and quizzing difficult.

One thing impressed upon me as I've considered this issue these past few weeks is that *speed is not the goal*. Fluency is the goal, and fluency does not always manifest itself in speed—at least, not right away. Speed is one way to demonstrate fluency, but not the only way, and testing for speed is unreliable in cases where other factors interfere with performance. Further, practicing speed doesn't always lead to speed anyway! (Just like practicing sight-singing and dictation doesn't necessarily lead to being better at sight-singing and dictation.) And of course, if we want to set the stage for students viewing music theory class as a place of critical inquiry, focusing the study of music fundamentals on fluency alone will be counterproductive for many of our students. Instead, I want to start the critique on Day 1, and continue it throughout the entire course sequence.

My ideas here are woefully incomplete. This is definitely a work-in-progress for me. So I'm anxious to hear what ideas you all have.

However, I've been thinking about these general issues of fluency, critique, rigor, etc. for a while now. And now that I'm teaching Music Theory I again, there is a strong dissonance in need of a resolution. If you're interested in reading what I've written about these issues in general or in other contexts, here are a few posts and articles I've written. If you have ideas on how to apply these ideas in the context of studying music fundamentals, I'd love to hear them!
