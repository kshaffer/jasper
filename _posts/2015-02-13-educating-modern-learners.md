I've written three pieces recently for the journal *Educating Modern Learners*. The first two are behind a paywall, but the third and most recent can be read with a free subscription. EML requires only a three-month exclusive publication right, so all three of these will be published on this blog (or on another open-access site) in the coming weeks. For now, here are the links on EML: 

[**Sustainable Pedagogy**](http://modernlearners.com/sustainable-pedagogy/), published December 4, 2014

> When someone proposes a new idea in education, that proposal is often followed by the question, “But can you do it at scale?” While “at scale” can mean a variety of things, in this context, it usually means doing it big — maintaining the effectiveness while increasing the efficiency. But going big isn’t always best for students, and it isn’t even always best for the bottom line. . . . [W]hat if educators started thinking small again? Doing something important, doing it well, doing it sustainably, and helping others replicate the success?

[**Academic Freedom Is for Students, Too**](http://modernlearners.com/academic-freedom-is-for-students-too/), published January 8, 2015

> This is education. Not the universal meeting of a preset standard, nor the study of the brilliance of dead celebrities. Rather, education is the empowering of students to push against the standards, to discover and cultivate their own brilliance. To learn what it means to be free.

[**Homework Is a Social Justice Issue](http://modernlearners.com/homework-is-a-social-justice-issue/), published February 9, 2015

> Homework privileges students of privilege — students with multiple parents or guardians who do not work evenings, students without jobs and significant domestic responsibilities, students whose families can afford the technology necessary to do the work asked of them. While education is often held up as the antidote to poverty, it is quite possible that the opposite is the case. An education that is dependent on homework, especially if it requires expensive technology, may actually reduce social mobility.
