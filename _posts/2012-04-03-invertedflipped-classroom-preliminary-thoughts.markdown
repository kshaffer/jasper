I've been experimenting with flipped classroom or inverted classroom techniques lately. The inverted classroom comes in a lot of flavors, but it essentially means that _information transfer_ happens outside the class and that _active learning_ tasks take place in class. What I've been doing these past few weeks is giving the students a combination of readings and short videos for homework. Class activities either involve individual or group exercises while I am in the room to guide, correct, and answer questions, or they involve _peer instruction_ activities (following Eric Mazur) such as having the students answer questions anonymously using clickers and using those answers as the basis for class or small-group discussion.

The most recent example would be today's class. This week, I introduced the students to voice-leading in contemporary Christian worship musicâ€”writing alto and tenor parts to accompany a given melody and chords in a pop-ish (not _popish_, mind you!) style. In preparation for class, I had the students review keyboard-style voice-leading principles we've covered already, then read a five-page document (update: document replaced by [this page](http://kshaffer.github.io/musicianshipResources/popRockVL.html) on Musicianship Resources site) on the particulars of contemporary vocal style harmony, and finally watch a [screencast video](https://vimeo.com/64117108) I made to demonstrate the task of arranging a worship song for melody, alto, and tenor and expose them to a couple of tricky situations they will encounter frequently. 

In class today, the entire 80 minutes was dedicated to the students working in partners on their laptops to arrange a worship song for melody, alto, and tenor. I gave them the melody and chords in a blank [MuseScore](http://www.musescore.org) file, and tasked them with transcribing a bass line and composing the alto and tenor parts.

The students had a lot of difficulty starting out on this task. That was entirely expected. But they had 80 minutes to talk to each other and ask me questions as I wandered around the room. I also had the opportunity to point out errors and problem situations to individual groups and to the large class as they progressed in their work. By the end, they all had a good start on the arrangement (a complete version of which is due on Thursday), and a number of their mistakes on the early part of the assignment have already been corrected. They now have both my demo and their beginning to refer to as exemplars of more-or-less good voice-leading in this style.

What I (and at least some of the students that gave me their thoughts) found great about this in contrast to last semester's lecture-then-do-homework-by-yourself approach is that the students could ask questions of me from the start of the assignment through the halfway point without opening email or coming to office hours; it was just part of class. I also enjoyed that one of the expectations for the day was getting things wrong . . . and then fixing them. In the lecture-then-homework approach, I had a hard time convincing the students it was okay to do poorly on an assignment (even if there were several on the same topic). But today, it seemed obvious that they were going to mess up and get correction along the way. In fact, that's what they wanted before they left. And, of course, no one who came to class got away without me seeing some of their work (which is possible in lecture-then-homework if they don't do the homework).

I'll try to report more on this specific assignment once they've completed it and gone through revisions. But from what I saw today (and the other classes in which we've tried similar techniques this semester) in comparison with last semester's counterpoint lecture-then-homework approach, this seems to be far superior. The student comfort level with the task was definitely a lot higher, as well, even though I threw them into the fray more today than in post-lecture homework assignments in the past. It makes me a happy teacher, and I think the students are getting more out of the activities. (Though that will be confirmed on Thursday!)
