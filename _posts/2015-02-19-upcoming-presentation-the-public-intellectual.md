Abstract

When people Google your name or your topic of research, what do they find? Digital humanist Melissa Terras writes that "academics need to work on their digital presence to aid in the dissemination of their research, to both their subject peers and the wider community." Likewise, Christopher Long writes that scholars "who do not intentionally cultivate an online scholarly presence will increasingly be at a disadvantage both professionally and academically." In this presentation, Kris Shaffer will share what recent web analytics reveal about the impact that online activity can have on a scholar's impact and visibility, making the case for more regular public engagement in academic work, especially from graduate students and early-career scholars. A mini-workshop will follow, demonstrating how scholars can take advantage of specific tools to engage wider audiences, including blogs, popular press, social media, and curating a "domain of one's own."
