_This post is a revision of my earlier thoughts on student blogs, now in the form that I plan on giving students at the beginning of this semester. As always, feedback is welcome, and feel free to reuse or modify this post for your own purposes (see Creative Commons License at the end of the post)._



One of the overarching objectives for the Musicianship curriculum at CSU is that students be able to communicate verbally about music, clearly and persuasively. The ability to speak or write about music, critically examine the thoughts of others about music, and revise one’s own thoughts and writings based on the work of others is essential both to a liberal education and to all fields in which music-school graduates find work.





With this in mind, writing will be a substantial component of every semester of the Musicianship sequence. And to that end, all students will maintain a public blog about music. You will be required to post regularly, read the blogs of your classmates, comment on some of your classmates’ posts, and revise some of your own posts based on comments received (keeping in mind that not all of the comments will be helpful in improving the post). To help you connect with each other, and with a potential wider audience, you will also be required to use a public Twitter account. (It can be one you already have, or a separate one devoted only to this class.) Each new blog post should be linked on Twitter and given the appropriate course hashtag (#musi198, for example). You can then follow the course hashtag as a saved search to keep track of each others’ posts. (The Twitter account can also come in handy for asking each other questions while doing coursework.)





The topics of your posts will be up to you, as long as they are about some aspect of music. However, in most semesters there are analysis or faith-and-music objectives that will be assessed based on blog posts, so some of your posts will need to address those issues. The point is not to produce a certain kind of essay (which only exists in college anyway). The point is to demonstrate mastery of musical analysis and mastery of written discourse about music.





## Why public blogs?





The public nature of these blogs may make some of you uncomfortable. But I have a few reasons why I think it’s important that you start writing in public (besides the obvious fact that it makes it easier to share and follow each others’ writings).





First, musicians are artists, and the act of putting something creative out for public scrutiny is a regular part of every musician’s life. The first two years of university is a good time to become comfortable with that, and to learn how to deal with the stresses and criticisms that come with it, in a relatively safe environment.





Second, musicians are humanists, and the act of contributing to human knowledge or critically evaluating some piece of received wisdom is a fundamental part of the humanities. The ability to participate in learned discourse in one’s field is part of what it means to be liberally educated in a humanistic discipline; the ability to provide the professor with the information s/he wants is not. Further, as world citizens with music degrees from a liberal arts institution, you will be the “experts” that many of your friends, family members, and colleagues will call on to provide wise responses to at least the musical aspects of our culture. Learning to write as knowledgable people for a specific public audience, then, is an important thing for you as musicians to learn, and these classes will be, again, a relatively safe place for you to get their feet wet.





Third, these blogs will be public because you _already_ have valuable things to say about music. You can always delete these posts before you go on the job market or apply to graduate school. But you have things to say now about something that plays an important part of people’s lives. You will refine their thoughts and your ability to communicate them in these courses, but you already have ideas that will be of benefit to more than just their classmates (and especially your professor!).





## Assessing blogs





There are a number of objectives that you must meet each semester regarding your writing before the end of the term. In addition to specific tasks like maintaining a blog, posting a minimum number of times, commenting, revising, etc., these objectives include things like:







  * Generate an original thesis based on musical analysis.  
  * Identify and write appropriately for a target audience.  
  * Construct clear linear argument in support of a thesis and devoid of unnecessary details.  
  * Use musical terminology appropriately and effectively.  
  * Demonstrate mastery of _Chicago Manual of Style_ for writing on music and citing sources.  
  * Write constructive critical responses to classmates’ writings on music.  
  * Respond to or revise an analytical writing based on comments received from readers.  
  * Demonstrate working knowledge of copyright and intellectual property law.  
  * Demonstrate awareness of open/closed access issues, and license all blog posts with an appropriate license in light of that knowledge.


These are the skills I want all my students to master. And, in all honesty, they are skills that your future employers want you to master (or need you to, even if they don’t know it!). And you don’t need to master them only (if at all) in reference to a 5–6 page paper, double-spaced, 12-point, etc. You need to master them in reference to writing, generally.





You also don’t need to learn only how to improve based on a professor’s (functionally infallible) comments. You need to learn how to critically evaluate comments that may be good or bad (or some of both) and revise based on the best feedback you can discern. In my opinion, typical college papers don’t do either of these things well, if at all. But a blog just might.





## Setting up your blog





There are many places to go to host a new blog. Some of the more popular are [WordPress.com](http://www.wordpress.com), [Blogspot](http://www.blogspot.com), and [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com). There are also software packages such as [WordPress.org](http://www.wordpress.org), and [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) that can be downloaded and installed on a web server. If you don't already have a blog or a preference, I recommend WordPress.com. It is feature-rich, stable, offers generous storage space for media, and doesn't give your personal information to someone trying to sell you something. It also has good documentation and a large user community in which to find help with setup or use, if needed.





Whatever service you use, _make sure your name is clearly identified on the site_. If I don't know it's you, I can't assess you. And if your classmates don't know whose work they are reading and responding to, the online and in-person discussions cannot connect. Further, as we are seeking to work within a biblical framework, it is important that you put your name to your work for the sake of accountability. Internet anonymity often leads to less-than-charitable dialogue, especially when offering criticism and difference of opinions. Be clear who you are, and act in accordance with the reputation you want to build. And keep in mind that particularly when you write about topics related to the Christian faith, your activity will also contribute to the reputation of Christ and his Church.





## Setting up your Twitter account





Go to [Twitter.com](http://www.twitter.com), and follow the signup instructions. Again, be sure that your identity is clear in the user name, Twitter handle, or bio. Also, remember to use the course hashtag in your class-related posts. You are _not_ required to follow your classmates. You _are_, however, required to use a public account. If you want to keep your non-class-related tweets private, make a second account for class that is public.





Though you are not required to follow your classmates, you must keep tabs on the course hashtag. Any Twitter posts tagged for your course constitute _required course material_, and they may include class-related announcements from me as well as links to new materials on the course website when they are created. Check the course hashtag at least once a day.





I highly recommend using an application that tracks multiple feeds at once, such as [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/) or [HootSuite](http://hootsuite.com/). You can search for the course hashtag, save the search, and then add the saved search as a new feed in your app. (The regular Twitter apps for desktop and mobile allow you one feed at a time, but you can switch to a saved search like the course hashtag feed.) 





## Getting help





If you have any questions about the technical aspects of setting up and posting to your blog or twitter feed, please search the internet, ask me in person or in the comments below, or ask us all on Twitter with the class hashtag. (You also may find it helpful to use other classes’ hashtags as well, to solicit help from students in other courses.)





Good luck, and happy blogging!
