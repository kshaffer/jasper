A few months ago, I rejoined Facebook. At the time, I said:

> So I guess I'm back on Facebook. [As I blogged yesterday](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2015/02/my-new-social-media-posse/), I've found some tools that help me maintain control and ownership of my data while still connecting with friends and colleagues on proprietary social media platforms. So I'll give this a whirl. I really don't like being beholden to social media companies and their decisions, and Facebook is probably the worst in my book. But hopefully my new setup will help me worry less about Twitter, Facebook, etc., so I can spend more of my time reading, writing, and connecting with you all.

Well, the honeymoon is over.

Yes, I found a way to control the data I post on Facebook by posting it to [my own site](http://sketches.shaffermusic.com) first and syndicating it to Twitter, Facebook, etc. But there are a couple problems. First, Facebook is throttling that process. In order to get more websites embedding Facebook's Open Graph code in the background, Facebook has made it *harder* for web authors to have their pages show up with nice, attractive previews when someone shares them on Facebook. I've noticed this getting worse lately, probably as Facebook gears up to start their own news distribution service. (After all, for that to be profitable, they need a tiered platform where they control what people see most readily, right?) A real *social media* platform would work to make everything smooth (remember when we used to be able to scroll through which image on a page we wanted to use as the "highlight" when sharing?), not remove features simply to charge for them.

Second, while I still (mostly) control the data I *post* to Facebook, that's not the only data Facebook collects from us, and we have absolutely no control over most of it. Not only does Facebook track every click, like, share, search, etc. while we're on Facebook, they track what we do on other websites even when we're logged out. Even on your in-law's computer! (Remind me to tell you that story some time.) I'm tired of having everything I do logged, stored, and analyzed by the NSA, the FSB, GCHQ, and any web server that happens to get a cookie installed on my computer when I dropped by to read an article. Enough is enough. I can't stop it all, but I'm not going to keep handing that data over myself.

Of course, it's not just Facebook. When asked what regular people can do to protect their privacy online, Ed Snowden said two things: encrypt it, and get rid of big offenders like DropBox, Facebook, and Google. I've decided to follow this advice. When I get some time, I'm going to try out [OwnCloud](https://owncloud.org/) — an encrypted and free (if you run it yourself) alternative to DropBox. I'm also looking into ways to minimize me Google usage — no more Google analytics on my website, Firefox instead of Chrome, [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) instead of Google.com searches, and I'm going to test [TutaNota](https://tutanota.com/) for email — an end-to-end encrypted email service hosted in digital-privacy-friendly Germany. And I'm leaving Facebook. Again.

I'll hang out on Facebook for a little while longer, making sure I have ways to keep in touch with those with whom I basically only interact on Facebook. And I'll use that time to try and convince as many others as I can to come with me. (Twitter is friendly, and [IndieWeb](https://indiewebcamp.com/) tools like [Known](https://withknown.com/) are even better for connecting while maintaining data control.) If anyone is convinced to make the move with me, I'll gladly help you get setup on a more privacy-friendly, freedom-respecting platform. And if anyone is interested in exchanging encrypted emails or text messages, let me know. :)

You all know where to find me online: this blog, my [sketches](http://sketches.shaffermusic.com) page (powered by Known), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/krisshaffer), and email (gmail for now, but let's encrypt!). I hope we can make a dent in this trend toward mass government and corporate surveillance. If not, we can at least not make it so easy for them.
