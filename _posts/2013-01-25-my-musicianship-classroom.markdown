I've been meaning for a while to post these pictures of my classroom. This year, we moved all the musicianship courses to the keyboard/computer lab, which has been awesome for the "inverted" approach to teaching music theory and aural skills. We do a lot of small group and partner work, and make heavy use of the keyboards and computers for composition, analysis, and performance activities. Putting the keyboards into clusters, rather than rows, has been great for thatâ€”both for facilitating group work rather than lecture, and for making it easier for me to wander around the room to observe and coach students.

Without further ado, here are the pics! (Click to enlarge.)

I also have a new office this year, since this classroom is in a different building than my old office (which was, and once again is, a piano practice room). I've moved to a room _with a window_ and a lot more space. And my parents and in-laws gave me money for Christmas that allowed me to purchase this snazzy makeshift standing desk:

It's an IKEA Galant table with extendable legs. On top is an IKEA Galant table extension, with 6" Capita legs. It just sits on top (the table's extendable legs don't quite get the table high enough for me, so this gives me a few more inches), and I can take it off if I need to. 

I really enjoy standing while I work. I work faster, I can drink less coffee without hitting an afternoon slump, and I sleep better (if my four-year-old lets me!). When I'm writing, I like to pace around while working out ideas, so a standing desk is perfect for alternating writing at the computer with pacing around the office while I think out loud. (I don't have any pictures or video of that particular workflow. Sorry!)

Thus ends the tour. If you're local, feel free to stop by in person. Visitors are always welcome. (Hecklers, however, will be booted to the curb.)
