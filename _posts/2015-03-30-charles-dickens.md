> I thought it much to be regretted that Richard's education had not counteracted those [negative] influences or directed his character. He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt, I understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most admirable manner. But I never heard that it had been anybody's business to find out what his natural bent was, or where his failings lay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to *him*. *He* had been adapted to the verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection that if he remained at school until he was of age, I suppose he could only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had enlarged his education by forgetting how to to it. Still, although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful, and very improving, and very sufficient for a great many purposes in life, and always remembered all through life, I did doubt whether Richard would not have profited by some one studying him a little, instead of him studying them quite so much.

\- Charles Dickens, *Bleak House*, "Esther's Narrative," p. 182
