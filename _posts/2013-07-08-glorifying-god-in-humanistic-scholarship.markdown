The Christian Scriptures teach that all things exist for the glory of God, and that whatever we do, we should do it for the glory of God. If that is the case, and if humanistic scholarship is generally based on the question *what does it mean to be human?*, then what place does humanistic scholarship have for the Christian? If "from him and through him and to him [referring to God] are all things" ([Romans 11:36](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+11%3A36/)), then how does one approach humanistic scholarship?

I've been thinking a lot lately about the questions: *What does it mean to do scholarly work for God's glory?* and *How does one teach students to do the same?* One perspective I've been considering comes from John Piper's book *Think: The Life of the Mind and the Love of God* (available as a free PDF download from [John Piper's website](http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/think)). Piper's argument in this book is that the ground of all Christian thinking should be love for God and love for people. Christian thinking that does not serve God or people in love, or which steals glory for the thinker rather than God, is "insurrection" and an "abdication of scholarship" (Kindle locations 267-68).

Piper's arguments, which I find Biblically solid, have been challenging for me as I've usually held to the God-is-honored-in-any-work-done-well position. However, even when considering all work done well to be potentially God-glorifying, there are ways to work well that serve God and there are ways to work well that serve ourselves. There are ways to work well that demonstrate that we value God above all, and ways to work well that demonstrate that we value something else above God. In other words, work can glorify God, or work can be idolatry.

For example, Piper states that Christian thinking should seek to *know* (and by extension, one would imagine, to *teach*) rather than *be known* (Kindle location 2175). In other words, the very same act of research could be God-honoring or idolatrous: God-honoring if done in service of knowing God and his work better, or of sharing that knowledge of God with others; idolatrous if done for the purpose of making a name for oneself. Of course, the trick is that our motives are rarely completely honorable or evil. When I research or teach, even if my conscious motives are godly, I am sure that my own ambition is also a motivating factor.

This is an important thing to consider as Christians, and as Christian scholars. As regenerate people in whom a sinful nature still dwells and works, many of our actions are bound to be both holy and blasphemous. As a friend of mine (and elder at our old church in New Haven) once said, “To be a Christian this side of death is, by definition, to be a hypocrite.” Though we value holiness and strive for it, even our good deeds will be tainted by sinful motives. The same is true for scholars.

So the trick is not figuring out what kinds of humanistic scholarship or pedagogy are God-honoring and what kinds of humanistic scholarship or pedagogy are sinful. The trick is often recognizing the conflict in our motives and seeking in all that we do to glorify God and serve his people. Paul’s exhortations regarding food and drink in the New Testament church (whether or not to eat food sacrificed to idols, whether or not to obey the OT dietary restrictions, see [Romans 14](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+14/), [I Corinthians 10](http://www.esvbible.org/1+Corinthians+10/), and [Galatians 2](http://www.esvbible.org/Galatians+2/)) are helpful. Neither eating nor not-eating is inherently godly; rather, whether we eat or drink, we are to bring glory to God. How? By exercising our freedom to eat or not eat in a way that builds up those around us, rather than tearing them down. In other words, we glorify God by acting out of love for those around us, not out of a desire to fulfill our own appetite (even when that appetite is not a sinful one).

So, again, the question is how to work this out in the context of scholarly work in the humanities. How can a humanist research, critique, and teach in a way that glorifies God and serves his people? That’s the question I hope to dig into more in future posts. In the mean time, what answers have you found? If you've considered these questions, what resources have you found helpful for your thinking?
