In a [previous post](/2013/06/building-a-database-of-academic-blogs/), I announced a project to create a database of academic blogs. So far, 250 academic bloggers from a number of different fields have added their sites to the database. If you have not, please do so by filling out the Google form on that earlier post.

If you are interested in checking out the blogs in the database, you can view it as a spreadsheet here: [http://bit.ly/acadBlogs](http://bit.ly/acadBlogs).

I have also put together OPML files for the database as a whole and by category. (An OPML file is simply a file containing a list of blog feeds so that you can import them into a feed reader all at once. Chances are if you follow blogs, you've already done that this week!) Here they are, as of June 3, 2013 (I'll update these periodically in future posts):

- [whole database](/media/acadBlogs/all.xml)
- [arts](/media/acadBlogs/arts.xml)
- [business](/media/acadBlogs/business.xml)
- [education](/media/acadBlogs/education.xml)
- [engineering](/media/acadBlogs/engineering.xml)
- [humanities](/media/acadBlogs/humanities.xml)
- [law](/media/acadBlogs/law.xml)
- [library science](/media/acadBlogs/libsci.xml)
- [life sciences](/media/acadBlogs/lifesci.xml)
- [physical sciences and mathematics](/media/acadBlogs/mathsci.xml)
- [social and behavioral sciences](/media/acadBlogs/socsci.xml)
- [other](/media/acadBlogs/other.xml)
