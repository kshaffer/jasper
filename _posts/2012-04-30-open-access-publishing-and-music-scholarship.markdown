A couple very interesting threads have come up lately on the SMT-Talk mailing list (for the Society for Music Theory). One is on textbook publishing, and another on open-access publishing. (Actually, the latter was my fork of the former.) Some exciting things are happening, like the forthcoming creating of a [new website](http://www.choralnet.org/view/297880) hosting contributed heretofore unpublished pedagogical materials for music theory. But so far, a lot of the discussion on open access has centered around making material free to download on the web. But that isn't the whole picture when it comes to open, free access. Here's my recent email to the list. I think that some from other disciplines or subdisciplines may be interested to see what's being discussed. And I hope that a few of you may have thoughts to contribute from outside the membership of the Society for Music Theory.

Here's the message:

Dear Colleagues,
So many interesting threads right now, but alas it is finals week here. Probably for the best, since I could write far more than any of you would like to read on these matters! However, I have a few more thoughts on open access that I'd like to share.

First, thanks to Steve and Jennifer for the reminder about the JMTP site. It sounds like it has potential to do some great things, and I hope as well that there will be a substantial "community effort." Also, thanks to Yonatan for the [list of open access music journals](http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=subject&cpid=6&uiLanguage=en). Very helpful, and I hope to see the list grow as more journals move their material to the open web.

Putting vetted material on the web for free download, though, is only one facet of open access. The open-source software (OSS) community often contrasts "free as in beer" with "free as in speech" or "free as in freedom" when discussing what it means for software to be free. Free to download and use as is within certain terms of use is a very good thing (free as in beer). But free to manipulate, re-create, enhance, break, rebuild, and contribute brings a whole other set of benefits (free as in freedom). For one, open-source software problematizes the developer/user divide and puts forward more of a community of developers, users, and developer-users.

While the developer/user (author/reader, perhaps) model has its place in academia, I think the model of a community of developer-users (or simply "researchers" or "scholars" or "pedagogues") makes more sense of much of what we do as music scholars and teachers. Academic research and teaching often necessitate manipulation, re-creation, breaking, rebuilding, etc. But free-as-in-beer publishing doesn't fully promote that. Developer-users must still think about the difference between infringement and fair use, derivative v. transformative use, etc., and the vetting process means that new information cannot get out quickly.

However, there are a couple things we can do in the sense of "free as in freedom" publishing that can foster more of a developer-user community, to the benefit of our scholarship and teaching:

1) A small thing we can do is to license our materials (in print and especially on the web), whenever possible, with a Creative Commons BY license. Here's a great, short article on why that particular license makes good sense for humanities scholarship: [http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by/](http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by/). (I hope the new JMTP site will use this license or something close to it in order to ensure the greatest possible potential for use of the materials hosted there.)

2) A more substantial thing we could do (which gets more toward what I believe Bob was suggesting) is to aggregate and "curate" as a society the material available on the open web relating to music theory (or along with our colleagues from other societies, music scholarship more generally considered). A great model for this comes from Digital Humanities Now and the Journal of Digital Humanities. Details can be found on their respective websites ([Digital Humanities Now](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/how-this-works/) and [Journal of Digital Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/about/)), but in a nutshell, DHN aggregates content on the open web relating to the field of DH; editors pick the most substantial original work and label them "Editors Choice"; followers of DHN are driven to those articles where they provide comments, criticism, and questions for the authors; authors make revisions based on those comments; and the best revised articles are chosen by the editors for placement in the JDH (which is available for free in HTML, PDF, and ePub).

The combination of these two things means that new scholarship can get out fast, and the quality can be quite high (due to the high number of potential reviewers and the small percentage of submissions that ultimately make it into the journal, at least in the case of JDH). The peer review process is also entirely transparent, and the articles that are finalists but not chosen for the journal are still widely publicized and receive substantial review.

I hope these two specific ideas that are taking root in other fields will take off in music scholarship, as well. I'm planning on using CC-BY with my work whenever possible. I'd also love to be involved in laying the groundwork for something like DHN/JDH for music, if there is enough community interest and some potential collaborators.

Happy finals week!
