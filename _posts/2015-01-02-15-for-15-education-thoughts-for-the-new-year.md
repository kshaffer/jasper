*My first blog post of the year brings 15 thoughts on education to start the new semester. Most of these come from things I've written or co-written in the past year. Some belong to pieces I'm thinking about writing. All are framing my thoughts as I prepare to start a new semester. I hope they are edifying — or at least though provoking — for others, as well!*

Not every student needs to learn the same things.

[Humanize, don't normalize.](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/love-time-peer-review/)

A school is not a business.

Equity doesn't guarantee fairness, justice.

[Scalable isn't necesarily sustainable.](http://modernlearners.com/sustainable-pedagogy/)

Resist the urge to measure everything.

The most important aspects of education are often [difficult, if not impossible, to assess](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/open-letter-students/).

We don't need best practices. We need a [praxis arsenal](https://twitter.com/krisshaffer/status/434360551603314688).

Educating students has nothing to do with ranking students.

In a power structure, [discipline isn't necessarily a virtue](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL26841W/Discipline_and_Punish).

Students are agents, [subjects in their own right](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/11/more-humanity-in-the-humanities/).

[Education, at its core, is an act of love.](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/love-time-peer-review/)

[Focus more on the work of our students](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/11/more-humanity-in-the-humanities/) than the work of dead artists.

[Ask questions that don’t have answers (yet)](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/09/starting-off-with-critical-pedagogy/).

[Shut up for a while.](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/09/starting-off-with-critical-pedagogy/)
