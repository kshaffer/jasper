We're almost two weeks into the semester now, and things are going really well. In fact, better than I hoped. I made a lot of changes to the musicianship/theory curriculum and class structure, with the support of my departmental colleagues (and especially my department chair). Those changes have made my classes hardly recognizable from last year, but in a good way. So far, not only am I enjoying myself more, but the students seem to be learning faster and enjoying themselves more as well. Though the proof will be in the end-of-semester pudding, I can already tell that these were changes worth making—both for student mastery and for my sanity!

The first big change was combining what were formerly separate music theory and aural skills classes into a single, five days a week, musicianship class. This has made a huge improvement in the courses, and I am incredibly thankful that my department chair supported my request to make the change while I was still in my first year at CSU. In Musicianship I, for example, this combination has meant we can spend the majority of our class time on developing solid aural skills while the students brush up on fundamentals and notation outside class (with regular quizzes to keep them progressing). Last year, the theory class had to keep moving, regardless of progress in aural skills, and that meant the students were composing exercises in minor keys before we even began singing in minor keys in aural skills. (The first step in composing those exercises is _supposed_ to be singing the given melody!) This year, they will have a solid foundation in singing, listening, and playing at the keyboard before we start any theory, composition, or analysis.

The second big change has been to move class from a large classroom with desks and a single grand piano to the keyboard/computer lab. We have enough keyboards for all the Musicianship III students, and almost enough for all the Musicianship I students (a few have to share). There are also enough computers for those who don't have a laptop or tablet they are comfortable bringing every day. This has been _huge_. Having the Musicianship I students beginning their singing and dictation work with access to a keyboard has meant a far more rapid development of skills in these early classes. And having the Musicianship III students in front of a keyboard during their review of harmony from last year means they can play and sing more readily the musical structures they are analyzing. The Musicianship III students learned last year to reduce any piece they study to a figured bass line (a single line of notes and rhythms for the lowest voice/instrument on the staff, with chord symbols above it), and now I can teach them to play and/or sing harmonic progressions from a figured bass line! Possessing that skill and sitting right in front of a keyboard for all of their in-class work will allow them to dig into musical structures much more deeply, and learn to recognize them much more quickly. And though I miss having a "real" piano, I don't miss it that much. Honestly, I don't use it much anymore because the _students_ are using theirs!

Of course, having students sitting at keyboards and computers means that I would be a fool to do a significant amount of lecturing. So all of these classes are "inverted" or "flipped." To many, an "inverted" class means video lectures at home and homework in class, but that's not what we're doing. They still have a textbook (though I'm trying to replace it gradually with materials I put on the course website, some of which are text and some of which are video). The change is that without lectures, they actually have to _read_ the book (!), and class time can be better used by incorporating _peer instruction_ techniques and piano-based work (performance, composition, or analysis).

It was a fluke of scheduling last year that first led me to consider having musicianship classes in the keyboard lab. But once the thought entered my mind, it seemed like a no-brainer. And now that I've done it, I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to teaching theory and aural skills in a regular classroom.

The last big change was the grading system. After trying a version of criterion-referenced/standards-based grading last semester, I put a lot of time this summer into coming up with an improvement on that for this year. The [form I settled on](/2012/08/introduction-to-criterion-referenced-grading/) essentially boils down to a list of course objectives that each student must meet. They can make as many attempts as necessary until the objective is met, after which they don't need to assess that objective again.

So far, this system has lead to several clear differences when compared with the average-based system I used last fall for more-or-less the same material. First, I am now directly assessing specific things the students are studying. I know exactly who knows their major key signatures or can sing their sequential scale patterns and who does not. Second, the students also know exactly what they have and have not mastered, and some are using that information well as they strategize their studies. Third, because failed quizzes en route to mastery do not bring down the final grade, student morale surrounding the daily fundamentals quizzes are much higher than last year. A failed quiz is not demoralizing, it is information and a benchmark for measuring improvement. And with multiple quizzes most class days (in Musicianship I), most students knock off at least one course objective each meeting.

Lastly, mastery of the course objectives is being achieved more quickly and by more students than last year. Take major key signature recognition, the first objective tackled this and last year in Musicianship I/Music Theory I. Last year, I gave five timed quizzes that included major key signatures. However, each one also included minor key signatures, scales, and on the last two, intervals. Looking at my grade book, I can see that on those five quizzes, 13% of them received passing grades. I also remember how much of a morale killer those timed quizzes were. Many students just gave up on the possibility of ever having a passing quiz average and focused their efforts elsewhere. 

This semester has been a completely different story. Two weeks into the semester, 32 out of 35 students have passed the major key signature recognition standard, which means correctly identifying 13 out of 15 major key signatures in 90 seconds on a 15-answer, multiple-choice, computerized quiz. 15 passed on the first attempt, 7 on the second attempt, 5 on the third, 4 on the fourth, and 1 on the fifth. I know for certain that this is much better than last year, but I don't have specific data from last year on key signature mastery, just holistic grades for each quiz. This points to two benefits of this new system: more students learning the material—and _really_ learning, at 13/15 correct in 90 seconds—and direct assessment of the skills required, which both I and the students can use to plan class activities and study strategies.

Altogether, I am having a great time teaching this semester, and I think the students are learning better and faster as well. Morale is also really high, in spite of the fact that I've given the Musicianship I students over 20 quizzes in 9 class meetings! I'm also getting to know some of my new students, and they're a great bunch. I'm excited to get to know them better and continue to help them grow as musicians. Hopefully the changes we've made this semester will continue to help us push towards that goal.
