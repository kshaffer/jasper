The last couple of weeks, I've been using a [THATCamp](http://thatcamp.org) trick in class: collaborative note-taking. I love it, and I highly recommend it.

For the most part, this has been in my aural skills classes. Rather than me telling them the kinds of things to look out for when sight-reading (performing music without a chance to practice first), for example, we've simply been spending a lot of time sight-reading, keeping a running list of pitfalls and tricks to sight-read better. In these situations, it has worked well to have a single "scribe" for the day—sometimes that's me. As we stand around the piano and sing from sheet music, it's hard for students to take notes, so they often don't. And honestly, I'd rather they not take notes and instead immerse themselves in the musical activity. However, there are things that come up during this activity that is worth remembering for future attempts to sight-read. (The fact that starting new phrases on pitches not part of the tonic triad—the "home" chord on which a piece of music tends to begin and end—is harder than starting phrases on pitches from the home chord, for example.) So I or a student take down these insights onto the course's discussion forum, [Piazza](http://piazza.com). Students can then review these easily as they practice on their own, or before/during subsequent classes.

Of course, having a class scribe isn't exactly collaborative, even if it reduces redundancy. But today in music theory, we had a discussion of [Music, philosophy, and the liberal arts](http://www.cplong.org/2013/09/music-philosophy-and-the-liberal-arts/#comment-2325). Because of our inverted-class approach, this was our first large-group discussion of the term. The students have grown accustomed to using Piazza to take notes as they [perform small-group analyses simultaneously](http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents/shafferpt3.html). We extended this practice today to include notes on our full-class discussion. They were encouraged to take notes in Piazza, but not to repeat anything already written by someone else.

Two very interesting things came out of today's collaborative note-taking. First, as discussion heated up and we unfortunately ran out of time, students unable to speak during class put their thoughts on Piazza, and a mini backchannel formed that spilled past the end of class time. ([Jesse Stommel](http://twitter.com/jessifer) and [Sean Morris](http://twitter.com/slamteacher) would be proud.) The second interesting thing that happened is that some students made mistakes in their note-taking. Stop the presses, I know! The interesting thing was that as I caught that after class, I was able to post a correction on Piazza. A [former me](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2013/08/convocation-address-on-the-inverted-class/) could only have dreamed of an efficient way to ensure that students' notes are correct. Now I've found one!

There are a lot of advantages to collaborative note-taking, as THATCampers and [FlipCampers](http://flipcamp.org) can attest. It frees up some participants to be more actively engaged, impresses upon "scribes" the importance of taking good notes *for the benefit of others*, eliminates the unnecessary redundancy that so often characterizes in-class activities, encourages students to engage the class beyond the boundaries of class time and location, and gives instructors an opportunity to correct student errors before they commit them to memory or base future work on misinformation. Additionally, if using a public forum (which we're not), it can enable a dissolving of the boundary of class membership: others can participate in class activities in some significant way without being physically present. This happens at both THATCamp and FlipCamp, and often the contributions of those not physically present are quite significant. 

(In fact, I didn't mention above that before the class discussion on the liberal arts, the students and I rode out the Boulder flood by discussing Chris Long's blog post on Piazza *with Chris Long*. It was wonderful to have his participation in our class, and I think it really helped the students better understand what they are doing as they study music in a liberal-arts setting.)

Again, I highly recommend incorporating collaborative note-taking in class. There is absolutely no reason why a room of 15, 35, or especially 200 students need dutifully to write down the same thing at the same time. If all an instructor is doing is delivering information, let her write it down for the students—or pick a cogent book or article on the subject and *let it do it's job*. And if students are doing something active and gaining insights along the way, don't make them all stop the action to write down the same insight—and certainly don't let them all ignore the insight. Why not try letting one person—perhaps even the instructor—take note, maximizing the efforts students can put towards engagement with the activity, while still noting the insights gained from that engagement.
