Last night's [\#profchat](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23profchat&src=savs) discussion centered around research-based innovation in higher education. We didn't give participants much warning about the topic, and therefore few had time to dig up their favorite articles and books to share.

Next Tuesday (8–9pm, EDT, on Twitter), we will follow up on this discussion, with plenty of warning! We hope that this discussion will allow us to make each other aware of resources that can help in our planning for the fall, as well as provide each other with ammo that may help us convince colleagues or administrators that our plans are sound and worth pursuing.

One topic that keeps coming up is assessment. In particular, many instructors are convinced that there are problems with traditional grading schemes, and even have found viable alternatives. However, they are worried that they will be unable to convince those in their department that need convincing to let them adopt the new method. There is a wealth of material available on assessment—from peer-reviewed journal articles to anecdata supplied on instructors' blogs—but it can be hard to find, especially when written by a pedagogue from another field.

With that in mind, I'd like to ask the #profchat community (and any others who are interested) to join me in crowdsourcing a bibliography on assessment. If you know of any resources—from a blog to a book to a syllabus to a journal article—on assessment in higher ed that has been valuable to you, or which you think would be valuable to others, please visit the [Google doc][bib] I created, and add the citation and link to the resource. Likewise, if you're looking for resources on assessment, please keep an eye on this document as it grows. (I'll try to provide updates on the project from time to time here.)

I hope that we can amass a fair collection of materials this week to feed discussion on Tuesday's #profchat, and I hope that over time we can create *the go-to resource* for those exploring new ideas in assessment.

Please dive in to the doc and start building!

P.S. I'd like to track the sharing and use of this doc. If you pass it along, please use the following bit.ly link: [http://bit.ly/assessBib](http://bit.ly/assessBib)
