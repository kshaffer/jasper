In my experience, students aren't [more likely to have a personal/family tragedy right before an exam](https://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume5/v5i6/GrandmotherEffect%205-6.pdf). They're more likely to *tell me about it* when there is a major or high-stakes project due soon. In other words, maybe they want to keep it private — which is totally within their rights — but the disproportionate power that grades and high-stakes tests hold over their future don't allow it. When the choice to keep private matters private comes with a grade penalty, grades usually win. And that's a pretty awful state.

Hopefully the fallout of these "Dear Student" pieces on Vitae and the criticism that they have spawned (largely thanks to Jesse Stommel) will lead us educators to think more carefully about what high-stakes work we put in front of our students. Yes, education should help students learn to deal with pressure — but that's not a reason for every assignment to come with major penalties for missing it, or for every topic of study to end with a major closed-book test. Yes, students should learn how to put together major work (papers, performances, apps, websites, etc.) and to work collaboratively, but that doesn't mean that every week needs to bring another major at-home group project. Let's be strategic about these things. And let's exercise generosity on the front end when we make those assignment decisions — and if possible let students have some part in making them — so that less students feel they need to share all of their private tragedies with their teachers in order to stay afloat academically.
