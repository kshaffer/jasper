I've finished a draft of my syllabus for Musicianship II (#musi199). The course will be divided into three units of study, each with firm deadlines. I've also finished a draft topic list/grading rubric for the first unit. I'm interested in feedback from fellow theory instructors and students. In particular, will students have a clear idea of the goals they are working toward and what specifically they should be working on at any given moment? Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

The documents are both on my [GitHub curriculum site](https://github.com/kshaffer/musicianship-curriculum).
