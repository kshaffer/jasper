_Next weekend is The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp) Southeast at Georgia Tech. I'm really excited about attending (and seeing my brothers who live in Atlanta, one of whom will be housing me and the family while we're in town). However, I've never been to one, and don't know what should go into a proposal. I'm going to wait until a few other proposals come in to see what format is most appropriate. (THATCamp.org is also currently down, so I can't scour for model proposals!) But in the mean time, I'm going to post here what I'm thinking about proposing. Any comments on this as a topic, or as a potential THATCamp proposal, would be most welcome._



# The Open-Source Textbook





Over the past year, I have been building an open-source, online, multimedia [textbook](http://kshaffer.github.com/musicianshipResources) for the four-semester course Musicianship sequence that I teach at Charleston Southern University. I began simply enough by creating materials for my students to supplement their textbook. These materials were at times filling in gaps, covering materials not in the text, and at other times, these materials incorporated newer developments in the field than is found in the standard textbooks. The more I did this, the less my students needed the book—and the more I felt guilty about having them buy it. 





When I switched to standards-based grading, my course objectives became very specific, and I needed more tailored resources for my students. And when I adopted the "inverted" class model, I could no longer just _tell_ my students what they needed to know that is not in the book. So I began converting my old lecture notes to online resources, and creating new materials to help students achieve my much more intentional course objectives. The result is a substantial (but still very much "in progress") website, containing text, graphics, and video, tailored to my students and to my course objectives. 





Doing this has saved each of my students over $200 in textbooks (and will save them still more when it is complete). It has also increased my students' engagement with the materials, since these materials are designed by someone who knows both them and the specific course goals and are, therefore, far more useful than their previous textbooks. In fact, it is rare for a student to read a page on this website only once. Instead, they tend to have multiple browser tabs open on this website as they work in class, making constant reference to the materials I have given them.





I made the decision early on to license this "textbook" with an open-content license—specifically the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (CC BY-SA). The CC BY-SA license ensures that my work is available to any instructor or student who would make use of it, as most CC licenses do. However, it also ensures that _any derivative works also belong to the community_, which also means that _I can take any modification or improvement someone else makes and fold it back into my original work_. This is the difference between _open access_ and _open source_. Open-access promotes consumption. Open-source promotes consumption, derivation, re-creation—in other words, hacking. Or in still another word, _scholarship_.





I also have hosted the "textbook" on Github. Github ensures not only reliable hosting, but easy "forking" (copying, modifying, and redeploying the site in another form). This is the best way I know of making this site both easy for me to maintain and easy for others to re-purpose for their own use.





In this session, I would like to demo my open-source textbook briefly, showing how I manage it, and how it can be forked, modified, and redeployed. Then I'd like to lead the group through an open discussion about the possibilities, advantages, and drawbacks of making more educational resources not simply _open access_, but _open source_: everything from a worksheet or test, to a syllabus, to a textbook, even to a course.





## A proposed model for an open-source textbook





What does an open-source textbook look like?

  * Available to students for free (electronic), or no more than the cost of printing  
  * Easy for instructors to modify  
  * Able to be "gated" by instructor (instructor has complete control over content of version of textbook used in her course)  
  * CC BY-SA, or similar license, to ensure that community can benefit from and build upon _all_ public versions of the textbook

What are the advantages of an open-source textbook?

  * No/low monetary cost for students and instructors  
  * Instructor can tailor content for her students (no one-size-fits-all)  
  * Instructor can tailor content for specific course objectives, projects, and assessments  
  * Instructor can change/augment/diminish material in the middle of the course if it is not meeting students' needs (I've even done this in the middle of a class meeting!)  
  * Entire community can benefit from innovations of individual instructors  
  * New developments in the field can make it into the textbook faster  
  * Easier for competing schools of thought to emerge and co-exist (since publishers' one-size-fits-all approach is no longer in control)  
  * Instructors who want to generate original material for students can build on community efforts, rather than start from scratch





What are the potential drawbacks of an open-source textbook?







  * Instructors must be careful about copyright infringement and fair use (no publishing house legal team)  
  * Contributions may not be considered for tenure and promotion  
  * Initial creation takes a lot of effort
