Today was my second try at using clickers in music theory class. If you're unfamiliar with clickers, also called "classroom response systems," they are basically a way for an instructor to ask a question and obtain an answer quickly from every student in the class. In the olden days (5–10 years ago), that involved students purchasing what looked like a TV remote and the instructor or university purchasing a radio-frequency receiver to plug into a computer (and probably some proprietary software). However, I use [Socrative](http://socrative.com), a free browser-based service that students can access from a laptop, tablet, or internet-enabled phone (most of my students used their phone). I get the results in a graph (for multiple choice or true/false questions) or a list (for short answer questions), which I can use myself or project on the screen for the class to see.

Clickers became famous, I believe, largely through the work of [Eric Mazur](http://mazur.harvard.edu/), who uses them along with "peer instruction" methods in large lecture classes. I have used them in my first-year theory class of about 30 students (and once in my 6-student second-year theory class).

The first time I used Socrative was during a class period where I played the students a classical keyboard theme, and they submitted (anonymously) whether they thought it was a sentence, period, or compound period (two sentences in antecedent-consequent relationship). The second time I used Socrative was today, where the students listened to Christian worship music and submitted (anonymously) the theological doctrine most strongly emphasized by the song. (They had just read and discussed the London/Charleston Baptist Confession, which has 31 topical headings for its theological content.)

A number of students have told me that they are more comfortable voting with Socrative than answering questions in class or raising their hands in a "manual" vote because it is anonymous, and they don't see what the other students think first. From my perspective, they also seem to open up more in class discussion after seeing the results of the voting. So far, the right answer (if there is only one) has never been one getting a slim minority of votes; it's always one of the top vote-getters. That means we can focus our discussion entirely on answers the students came up with in large numbers. That means that, whether a student is right or wrong (which they don't all know yet), when they know they're not alone in thinking what they thought, that added validation helps them speak up and defend their position. So far, the discussion has been more lively on these days, with a few typically quiet students speaking up much more than usual.

It's interesting that this method has benefits for a class of around 25–30. From what I've read, it's usually used in large lecture classes, and the post-voting discussion is done in many small groups. What we've done is use it as a spur for whole-class discussions. The class is large enough that some students are initially shy about speaking up, and large enough that we get meaningful numbers from the voting (not so much with the class of six), but small enough that we can still discuss things as a single group.

Though it doesn't work for things like voice-leading or sight-singing, it can work for conceptual questions and for high-level analytical questions like what formal type a theme or a pop song typifies, when the chorus starts, what key the transition modulates to, etc. And in the limited use I've put it to, it does seem to engage more students more fully in the discussion and give them a voice. Since the technology is free and _really_ easy, I highly recommend trying it out.
