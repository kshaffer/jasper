I'm excited that the upcoming joint conference of the Society for Music Theory, the American Musicological Society, and the Society for Ethnomusicology in New Orleans (Nov. 1–4) has its own Twitter hashtag: #musicon12. I'm also excited that a few music theorists I know are joining Twitter for the purpose of following the hashtag and seeing what Twitter is all about, and what a Twitter backchannel can add to a conference. Since this is the first year that SMT will have an online backchannel, and since many theorists are new to Twitter, blogs, and social media in general, I thought that I'd put together a few resources and tutorials for using "web 2.0" tools for scholarly engagement. This post will likely be the first in a series, starting with Twitter.





## Why Twitter?





Twitter has been a _huge_ part of my professional development this year. I am the only music theorist at CSU, and one of the few PhDs in a department filled with DMAs. (In other words, I'm a humanist surrounded by artists. Even the other humanities departments are in another building, separate from music.) Neither of these is a bad thing at all! I get a lot of freedom in my teaching, as well as constant reminders of the need for theory and analysis to be connected to musical practice. But when it comes to research, I am physically disconnected from my fellow humanistic music scholars. Having some online tool to connect me to a broader world of music scholarship, or humanistic scholarship in general, is a necessity.





The Society for Music Theory does have an email list. However, this is a closed list, available to society members only (though not strictly enforced, I think the only perpetrators would be lapsed members). As a result, discussion is very much in-house, without even the perspective of other music scholars from other sub-disciplines like music history and ethnomusicology. Also, as just about any list member will tell you, the level and tone of discourse on that list has greatly degenerated of late (thanks largely to a very small number of very vocal participants). Theorists are also a conservative bunch, academically speaking, and are slow to share their research and teaching developments until they are ready for publication. Thus the list is not all it could be, even within the narrow designation of _theory_, let alone embracing larger questions of musicological significance or interdisciplinary interest.





Twitter, however, has been great for making these connections. Within music theory circles, they have been very limited, simply because so few theorists are on Twitter and using it to anywhere near its potential. However, the American Musicological Society (AMS) has an account with several hundred followers, many of whom are real-life music scholars (some are even theorists!). Further, much of my recent research overlaps with the growing movement of _digital humanities_ scholarship, which is well represented online. I have made close connections with a few fellow scholars out there on Twitter, and I follow many more whom I have come across one way or another, and it is a great way to keep up-to-date about a number of scholarly developments. Sometimes it involves individuals posting pre-publication research on their site, sometimes links to articles and books of interest, some Twitter users "take notes" on Twitter when they are at conferences allowing those of us at home to chase down already-published material by those speakers, and some actually discuss real scholarly issues 140 characters at a time. As a result of Twitter, I discovered [_Hacking the Academy_](http://hackingtheacademy.org), numerous conferences I never heard of before but now want to attend, the [_Journal of Digital Humanities_](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org) (important both for its content and its submission/review process), and the [conference backchannel](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/encouraging-a-conference-backchannel-on-twitter/30612). It really has changed my scholarly life.





Twitter also has been amazing for my development as a teacher. There is a _huge_ community of university and secondary-level educators on Twitter sharing their ideology, experiences, and questions online. Thanks to Twitter, I discovered the _inverted/flipped classroom_ (the hashtag is #flipclass, and the regular weekly chat is Monday, 8–9pm Eastern) and an awesome community of teachers using standards-based or criterion-referenced grading. I have been able to see both the content and the process of developing curriculum for the teaching of writing (which I do but have minimal training in) by English teachers, and the teaching of math, programming, and statistics (which I use in my research but am largely self-taught) by math and computer science professors. As a result, not only have I learned from their writings on what they have done (none of which has appeared in a scholarly journal yet, let alone a journal I read regularly), but some of them have commented directly on my blog or responded to my tweets, giving me direct feedback on my specific ideas and experiences. All of this has helped me to improve my teaching methods more substantially and more quickly than I would have on my own.





Twitter has also been a part of how I get the word out about some of my pedagogical developments. Through that process, I've received (solicited and unsolicited) feedback I would not have otherwise, and I've been able to influence others' approaches to teaching before my materials are ready for publication. This has helped me to improve my teaching methods more substantially and more quickly than I would have on my own, as well as to have a greater influence, and sooner, on others' teaching. And when I am ready to put together articles for peer-reviewed journals, I will have more, better information from a number of instructors, most of whose work I would not know otherwise.





All in all, Twitter is super-powerful for scholarly connection and professional development. I highly recommend it, especially for those who, like me, are the only or almost the only scholar in your discipline at your institution.





## How to get started





Since I posted an announcement on the SMT announcement mailing list about the hashtag for our upcoming conference, I've received a few questions from theorists who see the value in using Twitter but aren't sure how to start. The best introduction to this comes from Ryan Cordell at the Chronicle of Higher Education blog, ProfHacker: [How to Start Tweeting (and Why You Might Want To)](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/how-to-start-tweeting-and-why-you-might-want-to/26065). Check it out and follow the links.





Aside from referring to Cordell's article, I should also say a few things about hashtags. Hashtags are what make Twitter so powerful. In general, on Twitter, you follow other people, and then what they post ("tweet"—I know, stupid, and probably the biggest hurdle an academic has to get over before joining Twitter!) shows up in your home feed. They don't have to follow you; it's completely one way, though many people do automatically follow those that follow them. This is a great way to connect with specific individuals.





However, Twitter also lets you connect with ideas, and hashtags make that possible. A hashtag is simply a term with a pound sign in front of it: #musicon12, for example. I may not want to see everything that everyone going to the conference says on Twitter. But I may want to see what people in general are saying about the conference, even if I don't follow them. And I also might want to send out a message to others at the conference, even if they don't follow me. That's what a hashtag is for. It allows me to follow an idea, rather than a person. And it allows me to jump into a conversation, even if I don't already have a connection with the others in that conversation. It's very powerful. Cordell's article covers the how bit just fine, so I'll leave that to him. But I didn't want to end this post without emphasizing the importance of hashtags. They are the life blood of scholarly connections on Twitter.





## Lists



One last thing. If you're new to Twitter as a music scholar and don't know where to start, take a look at my lists. I have a list of [music scholars](https://twitter.com/#!/krisshaffer/musicscholars) that I recently finished cleaning up—scholars who actually tweet about music. I also have a [digital humanities list](https://twitter.com/#!/krisshaffer/digitalhumanities), which is a combination of lists from a couple scholars who put together their own. (I used [TTYtter](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/) and Python to make it.) It can get you started finding some good people and hashtags to follow.



So this has been more of a why-it's-worth-doing than a tutorial. But I hope that I've made the potential value a little more evident for those on the fence.





Now all we need is a good hashtag for music scholars…
