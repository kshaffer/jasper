Today my dissertation advisor from Yale gave a presentation at CU. It was part of the music theory & musicology colloquium series, and the computer science colloquium series. It was an engaging talk, and it was great to see such a mix of musicians and computer scientists taking an interest. Here are some photos from the colloquium.
