Today I gave a [keynote presentation](http://ats.udel.edu/institute/category/june-3/) and led a breakout discussion session for the University of Delaware's Faculty Summer Institute. The presentation was titled, "Productive discomfort: Fostering learning in an inquiry-driven class." For those interested, here are my slides, with links to the articles cited. Enjoy!

*Note: most pictures are simply taken from the article cited on the slide. See those articles for photo attributions. The blank slides included pictures of my students in the live presentation, but I didn't want to post them on the web without their permission.*
