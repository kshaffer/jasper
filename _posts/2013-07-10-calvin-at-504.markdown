In addition to being Colleen's and my ninth anniversary, today marks the 504th anniversary since John Calvin's birth. Last summer, I was in Switzerland for archival research in the [Paul Sacher Stiftung](http://www.paul-sacher-stiftung.ch/de/home.html) in Basel. While there, I popped down to Geneva to visit two friends from New Haven who are currently living and [working](http://home.web.cern.ch) there. While in Geneva, we toured the Reformation sites. Here are a few pictures from that tour.
