After mulling it over for a while, I decided to go with WordPress over Google+ (or Blackboard) for my music theory and aural skills course websites this semester. The main reasons are that most of my posts with attachments will be PDFs or copyrighted audio materials. The former will not work with G+, and the latter are probably not a good idea to post on Google, even if I can keep the viewing/listening private. Wordpress will also make it easier to recycle my online materials in future semesters, keep the materials private (to protect the privacy of students writing comments and to allow me to post copyrighted course materials legitimately), and control the interface (since it lives on my webserver). 

The only down side I see so far when compared with G+ is that when I want to share something with all four courses, I have to post it four times. But, honestly, it's such a quick copy and paste job, that that is the least of my worries.

I already have the first couple of assignments, syllabus, and some resources up, and it looks like it's going to be a great enhancement to the class. Classes start Tuesday, so I'm sure I'll have more to say about this for interested readers once things are underway.
