> *The ability to evaluate one's own progress is an essential skill for any educated person, especially professional musicians. The ability to communicate one's mastery of various relevant topics and skills accurately and concisely is essential to finding and keeping a job. Finally, the ability to determine an appropriate level of mastery based on the material, and not on a rubric given by a superior, is one of the key marks of an educated person and independent learner. Further, it is essential if one wants to be successful in new ventures over the course of a career, not simply in a single career track the first few years after graduation.*

> *With all this in mind, the student—not the instructor—will be the primary assessor of his or her own mastery of the course material. The instructor will have the final say, of course, but it will be the student's job to keep track of progress, assess that progress, assess mastery at the end of each unit of study, and make a reasoned and supported argument to the instructor regarding their final grade for the course. Students who successfully make the case for the grade they have chosen will receive that grade.*

This is the beginning of the [self-evaluation guide][eval] that I have drafted for my classes at CU this fall.

I firmly believe in the importance of students learning to evaluate (and motivate) themselves, as well as learn how to defend their choices and communicate their skills to the non-experts who will be employing them and working with them. I have also come to the conclusion (for now, anyway) that [top-down grades have little positive effect in encouraging students to develop good working habits][grades] that enrich their lives or enhance their intellect and professional skills. (Grades can get some students to do things they otherwise may not have done, but not as often as conventional wisdom assumes—after all, we've had successful schools and universities centuries longer than we've had grades—and that coerced labor is rarely the enlightening exploration instructors would like to encourage.) Thus, I've decided this semester to focus my feedback to students into comments and advice given mostly in-class, and to focus the time usually spent outside-of-class in grading into responding to students' own self-evaluations and intervening with individuals who need extra attention but are not seeking it themselves.

I've also had a number of interesting combinations on Twitter with some fellow participants in the weekly #profchat discussions (an hour-long Twitter chat on pedagogy and teaching in higher education, Tuesdays 8–9pm Eastern time) on the role of syllabus. I have decided to shed all assessment and institutional policies from my syllabus in favor of a more traditional *summary* of course content and objectives. Information on assessment and course policies will still be given to students, but in separate documents, with the idea that the syllabus—and by extension, then, the course—is primarily about the material we will wrestle with together, not the bureaucratic necessities.

As an example, here are my materials for Semester 3 Aural Skills at CU:

- [syllabus][syl]  
- [policies][pol]  
- [self-evaluation guide][eval] (same as for Semester 3 Music Theory, which I posted previously)  
- [coursework guide][cour]

I'm sharing these for two reasons. 

First, there are some very new (to me) things in these materials, and I'd love feedback from other theorists and instructors of aural skills, as well as instructors in other disciplines that have made use of self-evaluations, criterion-referenced assessment, etc. This is also my first semester coordinating a course with TAs teaching the other sections. (There are five sections total, and I'll teach one and coordinate two TAs for the others.) Any feedback from those who have coordinated TAs on how these things might play out in that situation would be most helpful.

Second, I'd like to get some conversations going about the role of the syllabus in a course, [the goal(s) of an aural skills course][fluency], what kind of activities are most helpful in an aural skills course, and the possibility of "flipping" assessment. (The latter is the topic of [a session I proposed](http://flipcampmt.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/session-proposal-flipping-student-assessment/) for [FlipCamp Music Theory](http://flipcampmt.wordpress.com) next week.)
