One of the objectives for the Musicianship curriculum at CSU is that students be able to communicate verbally about music, clearly and persuasively. The ability to speak or write about music, critically examine the thoughts of others about music, and revise one's own thoughts and writings based on the work of others is essential both to a liberal education and to all fields in which music-school graduates find work.

With this in mind, writing will be a substantial component of every semester of the Musicianship sequence. And to that end, I've decided that I will have students each maintain a public blog about music. They'll be required to post regularly, read the blogs of their classmates, comment on some of their classmates' posts, and revise some of their own posts based on comments received (keeping in mind that not all of the comments will be helpful in improving the post). We'll probably also use a Twitter hashtag for the course, with students posting links to blog posts on Twitter with the hashtag, and following the hashtag to keep track of their classmates' writings.

The topics of their posts will be up to them, as long as they are about some aspect of music. However, in most semesters there are analysis or faith-and-music objectives that will be evaluated based on blog posts, so some of their posts will need to address those objectives (such as sonata structure). Otherwise, I'll encourage them to write about things that they and/or their audience (which will develop over time, no doubt) care about. The point is not that they produce a certain kind of essay (which only exists in college anyway). The point is that they demonstrate mastery of musical analysis and mastery of written discourse about music.

I've also decided that these blogs will be public, which I know will make some student uncomfortable. But I have a few reasons why I think it's important that they start writing in public (their current Facebook and Twitter activity notwithstanding).

First, musicians are artists, and the act of putting something creative out for public scrutiny is a regular part of every musician's life. The first two years of university is a good time to become comfortable with that, and to learn how to deal with the stresses and criticisms that come with it (in a relatively safe environment). 

Second, musicians are humanists, and the act of contributing to human knowledge or critically evaluating some piece of received wisdom is a fundamental part of the humanities. The ability to participate in learned discourse in one's field is part of what it means to be liberally educated in a humanistic discipline; the ability to provide the professor with the information s/he wants is not. Further, as world citizens with music degrees from a liberal arts institution, they will be the "experts" that many of their friends, family members, and colleagues will call on to provide wise responses to at least the musical aspects of our culture. Learning to write as knowledgable people for a specific public audience, then, is an important thing for these musicians to learn, and my class will be, again, a relatively safe place for them to get their feet wet.

Third, these blogs will be public because my students _already_ have valuable things to say about music. They can always delete these posts before they go on the job market or apply to graduate school. But they have things to say now about something that plays an important part of people's lives. They will refine their thoughts and their ability to communicate them in these courses, but they already have ideas that will be of benefit to more than just their classmates (and especially their professor).



## Assessing blogs



There are a number of objectives that students must meet each semester regarding their writing before the end of the term. In addition to specific tasks like maintaining a blog, posting a minimum number of times, commenting, revising, etc., these objectives include things like:





  * Generate an original thesis based on musical analysis.  
  * Identify and write appropriately for a target audience.  
  * Construct clear linear argument in support of a thesis and devoid of unnecessary details.  
  * Use musical terminology appropriately and effectively.  
  * Demonstrate mastery of _Chicago Manual of Style_ for writing on music and citing sources.  
  * Write constructive critical responses to classmates' writings on music.  
  * Respond to or revise an analytical writing based on comments received from readers.  
  * Demonstrate working knowledge of copyright and intellectual property law.  
  * Demonstrate awareness of open/closed access issues, and license all blog posts with an appropriate license in light of that knowledge.



These are the skills I want my students to master. And they don't need to master them only (if at all) in reference to a 5â€“6 page paper, double-spaced, 12-point, etc. They need to master them in reference to writing, generally. They also don't need to learn only how to improve based on a professor's (functionally infallible) comments. They need to learn how to critically evaluate comments that may be good or bad (or some of both) and revise based on the best feedback they can discern. Papers don't do either of these things well, if at all. But a blog just might.
