I put together an application this week to help me keep track of criterion-referenced/standards-based assessments and share reports with students. The application takes data from spreadsheet files, generates reports for each student, and shares those reports with them via DropBox. Here is a video that demos the application and how to use it:

The code is hosted on [my github page](http://github.com/kshaffer/gradebook). The application runs on Python and makes use of MultiMarkDown and LaTeX to generate the reports. (Links are on the github project page.) Both my application, and everything it depends on are open source.

If you use it, I'd love to hear from you. Especially if you have feedback, bug reports, or feature requests.
