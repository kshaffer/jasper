I pondered some things out loud on Twitter last week.

There were a few responses:

(That's just an excerpt.)

I brought up the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research, which is the closest thing I know to a "freelance university," and they jumped in on the conversation a bit.

Of course, the nature of the Twitter medium is for things to fade into the ether rather quickly. But this is something I want to keep mulling over, with some help. I keep tossing around the idea of at least putting together a couple independent courses—maybe summer courses for college-bound homeschoolers, or for people who are done with their degree but interested in a one-off educational project. Perhaps even an independent online course, free to participate in but with crowdfunded development.

Mostly I'm just thinking out loud, but I'm interested in hearing other ideas on this and keeping a conversation going. In light of the current state of the academic job market and the invasive, pedagogically troubling role that the US Dept. of Education is playing in K–12 and university education lately, the idea of a small, inexpensive, independent, faculty-run university—or even simply a smattering of courses here and there—could be attractive for many, on the faculty side and the student side. But would employers accept a degree from such a place? Would accreditation be possible? If the education is good enough and cheap enough (not requiring federal financial aid, which requires accredited instutitions), would accreditation even be necessary? Could faculty scrape together a living from something like this, the way freelance musicians and journalists do?

I should emphasize that I'm very happy in my current job; I'm not disgruntled and looking to leave! But I do like thought experiments like this. And with Cathy Davidson's MOOC on the future of higher education starting soon, it seems like an apropos time to discuss such a possibility.

So what do you think? In what situations would a freelance university be attractive to students? employers? faculty? Could it ever become a viable alternative to the modern university? How could one go about creating it? I don't know the answers, but I enjoy thinking about the possibilities, so please feel free to leave a comment and get some discussion going.
