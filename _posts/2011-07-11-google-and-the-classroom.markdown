When Google announced its latest attempt at constructing a social network a couple weeks ago, I wrote it off very quickly. I left facebook a year and a half ago mainly for security reasons, and since then have come to see how it changed the way my mind works in a bad way. That is, when something interesting or funny happens, I still think, “That would make a great facebook status.” It still controls my mind, even though I don’t have an account! In addition to that, there is the whole I-have-something-to-say-but-not-to-anyone-in-particular phenomenon. When something interesting happens, and I want to tell someone but don’t know whom (or just want to tell everyone), that’s not relational; it’s self-centered. When something happens and I think, “So-and-so would love to hear about that,” that is relationship. I want the latter, but facebook and Twitter pushed me toward the former. As a result, I am not on facebook (and have no plans to return), and Twitter is simply for announcing new blog posts. (Thanks to [Vasili Byros](http://www.music.northwestern.edu/faculty/profiles/vasili-byros.html) for articulating the psychological effects of facebook so clearly in his farewell address to the site, the same week that I left.)

So when I saw the announcement for G+, read the description, and received an invitation, I thought (along with many others), “not _another_ social network!” (I also saw the most touted G+ feature, Circles, simply as a way to share compromising pics/vids/comments without getting yourself into compromising situations. As one reviewer said, G+ solves the problem of what to do when you’re friended by your mother.) So as a social networking site, I have absolutely no desire to join G+.

However, I have recently read a number of reviews, articles, and blog posts recently by academics musing about how G+ could be integrated into the classroom: [Introducing Google Plus](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/introducing-google/34643) and [Professors Consider Classroom Uses for Google Plus](http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/professors-consider-classroom-uses-for-google-plus/32131?sid=wc&utm_source=wc&utm_medium=en), for instance, both from the Chronicle of Higher Education (follow links in those articles to many more). In the classroom, the “Circles” feature sounds incredibly helpful. Require students to join G+ and the circle for that class, and the professor and students can share and chat within that specific environment and keep it separate from their personal circles (or other classes). In my case, I could have a circle for each theory and aural-skills class, a circle for all current students, and a circle for all current and former students. Important class information could be shared, supplemental readings could be posted, schedule changes announced, etc.,for individual classes. Office hours scheduling could go to all current students from every class. And G+ promises to integrate well into Google Calendar (scheduling office hours and online discussion sessions), Google Docs (syllabuses, assignments, and collaborative projects), etc. The video chat even allows you to show a video to the others in the chat (up to 10), and there has been speculation of integration with PowerPoint and OpenOffice. (iWork can export as a movie or as PowerPoint, so hopefully that would allow me to share my slideshows in G+, as well.) These and many other features sound like great tools for the classroom (perhaps replacing things like Blackboard or ClassesV2, depending on what you use those sites for), as well as for research collaborations.

So this has me thinking more about the possibility of using it at CSU. The sophomore theory class (which will be focused less or rudiments and more on projects and reading/writing) is very small, and might be a good trial environment for it. Or I could wait to use it until I’m settled in the job and Google has worked out the kinks, or use it minimally until then (i.e., as a more convenient tool for sharing online resources, of which there will be many for my theory courses).

Have any of you explored G+ yet, or incorporated social media in the classroom? What are your thoughts?
