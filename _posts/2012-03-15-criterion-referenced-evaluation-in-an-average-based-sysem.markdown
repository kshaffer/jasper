As I mentioned in [my previous post](/2012/03/three-kinds-of-criterion-referenced-grading/), it is possible to use criterion-referenced rather than holistic evaluation of individual assignments, and do so within a traditional average-based system. For those who find average-based systems, where every grade counts toward the final grade, to be a significant motivator for student engagement, but who also see the value in evaluating assignments according to specific criteria, this may be a helpful model to consider. This post describes how criterion-based assignment grading can be combined with average-based final grade calculation.

First, each assignment in such a system would be evaluated according to any grading category that applies to it. For instance, an unfigured bass realization assignment might be evaluated under the following categories: keyboard-style voice-leading, cadence voice leading, cadence pattern recognition, harmonic syntax, functional bass symbols (or Roman numerals), and perhaps music notation software.

At the end of the semester, these categories and others will all contain a number of grades (traditional letter grades or percentages, or something like the 4-point scale I've previously described) from assignments, quizzes, and tests. A weighted average could then be calculated for each category (say with quizzes weighted at double a homework grade, and a test at triple or quadruple a homework grade). The result is about a dozen category averages (again, in letter-grade, percentage, or some other format).

Then just as a traditional final grade is calculated as a weighted average of quizzes, exams, homework assignments, participation, etc., the new final grade can be calculated as a weighted average of the category grades. For example, harmonic analysis symbols might be weighted more heavily than music notation software, but less heavily than keyboard-style voice leading.

The advantages to a system like I describe in this post include everything I've said thus far about criterion-referenced assignment grading (clear, concise feedback that directs student and instructor attention to specific problem areas; making sure the course stays on task; etc.) as well as having every assignment count toward the final grade, giving students motivation to do each assignment.

There is another advantage of this system when compared with the traditional grouping of scores by _assignment type_ (homework, quiz, test) rather than by _topic or skill_: it sets clear priorities for the class at the outset (assuming the weighting formula is in the syllabus) and ensures that a high number of assignments in one topic doesn't inadvertently give it too much weight for the final grade. Some topics lend themselves best to many small assignments (voice-leading), others to few large assignments (full-movement analysis of form or text-music relationships). This system ensures those topics are given appropriate relative weight with minimal number-juggling. It also allows an instructor to stipulate a minimum value for each topic to earn a certain overall grade, guaranteeing a certain established foundation for each aspect covered in the next course in the sequence.

(Whatever the grading system, I think a minimum level of competence that must be achieved across the board to pass is very important, and it can be done even in an average-based system. In fact, that's what Lawrence University (my alma mater) did for the three sub-classes of theory, ear training, and sight-singing. They used traditional holistic grading in an average-based system for each class, but each of the three courses must achieve a passing grade in order to advance to the next level of any of the three.)

For those who find that making every assignment count is a necessary motivator for some of their students to engage material regularly and who also find criterion-referenced assessment appealing, the system I described here may be a good fit, or at least a good fresh starting point.
