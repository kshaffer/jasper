*This is the second in my series of posts on educational fallacies. You can read all of them [here](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/tags/#educational%20fallacies).*

It is a common assumption in education that a difficult class is a rigorous class is a good class. There are three parts to this: difficult = rigorous, difficult = good, and rigorous = good. The first two are fallacious. But once we break down the assumption that difficult = rigorous (and define rigor with more nuance), there's something to the idea that a rigorous class is a good class.

Let's unpack this.

*What is a difficult class?* Is it one where students are asked to do a few difficult things? Or is it one where students are asked to memorize a lot of content? Both of these can legitmately be called difficult. Only one of these is intellectually rigorous.

*But what is rigor?* By rigor, I mean *deep engagement that leads to substantial intellectual—and, at times, also social—(re)formation*.

Fast note-taking, information cramming, reproducing "raw facts" or pre-interpreted ideas on an exam or in a paper may all be difficult, and they may help us differentiate students according to "objective" standards of "quality." But these tasks do *not* (re)form the intellect or challenge students to think in new ways. They simply give students a chance to display intellectual abilities they already possess—abilities that often amount simply to academic gymnastics or gamesmanship. That has nothing to do with education.

On the other hand, [activities that we might categorize as "play" can be quite rigorous](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/beyond-rigor/), if they deeply engage students' minds and push them to think and act in new ways. Some of these activities might even be difficult: for example, giving a student a difficult piece of music to master before an upcoming recital. But it is not the difficulty that provides the rigor. It is the depth of engagement, and the potential to change the way the student thinks and acts that makes it rigorous.

This kind of rigor is exactly what education should be about: intellectual and social (re)formation. Thus, a rigorous class—defined in this way—is a good class.

It is important to note that not only does difficulty not guarantee this kind of rigor or "good"ness, but if that unrigorous difficulty consumes time and energy that could have been spent on activities that stimulate the intellect, that difficult class is anti-rigorous, anti-educational.

What most educators usually mean by a "difficult" or "hard" class is not intellectually rigorous. And what most educators usually mean by "rigorous" is not good for our students' intellectual and social development. So the assumption that a difficult class is a rigorous class is a good class is fallacious. 

However, there is a kind of difficulty and a kind of rigor that *does* foster deep engagement and promote the (re)forming of the intellect. That is the kind of difficulty with which we should charge ourselves and our students. That is the kind of rigor we should pursue.
