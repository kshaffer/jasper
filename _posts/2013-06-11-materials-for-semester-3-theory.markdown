I have drafted a [syllabus](/media/Theory3-syllabus-June11draft.pdf) for the Semester 3 Theory course that I will teach this fall at CU–Boulder. I'm interested in any feedback I can get.

There are a couple of things I'm doing different in this course. First, the syllabus follows the historic definition of the word: a summary of course content, not a dumping ground for policies (including assessment), and certainly not a contract between instructor and student. I want it to highlight the course objectives and content only. 

Second, the syllabus is also not a schedule for each class meeting's events. (This part is not new for me.) By taking a student-centered and "inverted" approach to the course, I make those decisions relatively late as I gather information about where the students are at any given point in the course (formative assessment) and consider that against the objectives for the unit of study.

Lastly, as is hinted in this syllabus, this course will use criterion-referenced assessment, based on [student self-evaluations](/media/Theory3-assessment-June11draft.pdf). Each student will construct a self-evaluation document that they update each week in reference to any of the criteria covered that week. In this evaluation, at the end of every unit, they will choose a grade and make the case for that grade, which I will either accept or reject based on the strength of their case and the "evidence" they provide (coursework and/or briefly stated demonstrations of understanding in the self-evaluation).

I'm interested in hearing from other instructors and students what you all think of this: both the approach to the syllabus as summary (with [policies](/media/Theory3-policies-June11draft.pdf) and [assessment information](/media/Theory3-assignments-June11draft.pdf) in separate documents), and the self-evaluation approach to assessment. As you can see in the assessment guide linked above, I've tried hard to provide students some flexibility, while also including a lot of check points so that nothing blows up in someone's face at the last second. What are your thoughts on this?
