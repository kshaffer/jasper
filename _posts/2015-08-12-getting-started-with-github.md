There has been a lot of talk about GitHub at [Digital Pedagogy Lab](http://digitalpedagogylab.com) this week. Following are a few resources for learning and using GitHub for things like collaborative corpus-based projects, website publishing, etc.

> Scholarship is, by its nature, open source.

First is my *Hybrid Pedagogy* article, ["Open-source scholarship"](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/open-source-scholarship/). In this article, I argue that open-source is the fundamental nature of "traditional" scholarship.

I followed up with ["Push, Pull, Fork: GitHub for Academics"](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/push-pull-fork-github-for-academics/), a guide for using GitHub, primarily with a view towards creating, editing, and maintaining open educational resources (OERs) like open-source textbooks.

Finally, I created two nuts-and-bolts videos for using git and GitHub on the Mac:

Enjoy!
