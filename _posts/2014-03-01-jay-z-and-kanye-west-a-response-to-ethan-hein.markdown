After [my blog post response to Ethan Hein](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/02/what-is-music-theory/) (republished on [Hybrid Pedagogy](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/page-two/music-theory/)), Ethan left a lengthy comment, to which I replied, which led to more discussion on Twitter (with others joining in, as well). Several of us have claimed that the skills learned in the core music theory curriculum transfer well to other genres—even to things like hip-hop, and even when those skills were cultivated in the context of 18th-century classical music. Hein continued to express disbelief of our claims and examples. So I asked him to provide an example about which he thought the typical core music theory curriculum had little to say. He answered with Jay-Z's and Kanye West's "Otis," which heavily samples from Otis Redding's "Try a Little Tenderness." Videos of each song and a Storify of my Twitter response are below. This is, of course, not an extensive analysis, but enough to show how knowledge of tonal theory and classic song forms can be (in this case, I think, *must be*) employed to make a satisfactory interpretation of the meaning and structure of this song.
