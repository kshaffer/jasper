Today we practiced analyzing pop/rock songs by ear for formal structure in both of my music theory classes. For part of each meeting, I presented students with single formal modules (a verse, a chorus, a bridge, a strophe, or a prechorus) and asked them which function it likely fulfilled based on its internal structure. Later in the meeting, I gave them longer stretches of songs to analyze, using context to assist them in determining the function of different formal modules.

One of the examples came from "Must Be Dreaming" by Frou Frou (Imogen Heap being the most well known member). I played them the bridge of the song and asked them to vote whether they thought it was a strophe, bridge, chorus, verse, or prechorus. (We used [Socrative](http://www.socrative.com) in both classes, allowing the students to vote anonymously.) The trick to this passage (and most bridges in verse-chorus songs) is that the defining _internal_ characteristics of a bridge are almost identical to those of a prechorus. There are some subtle differences between the two (such as the fact that "energy gain" is more necessary to a prechorus than a bridge), but the main differences have to do with how they appear in context. (A bridge occurs once in a song, a prechorus several times; a prechorus almost always follows a verse, but a bridge never does.) So this was meant to be tricky. And while I was prepared to give them the context to assist them in their final decision, I wanted to see what they would do with it in isolation.

In both classes, the way this played out was interesting, and in completely different ways. In my first class (second-semester theory students), after hearing the passage twice in isolation, 11 of them voted in favor of it being a bridge, 3 a prechorus, and 3 a verse. Without giving them any hints (but showing them the voting results from Socrative), I then instructed them to take a couple minutes in groups of 3–4 to discuss and try to convince each other of their answer if they disagreed. We then revoted. The new vote was 17 for bridge, 1 for prechorus, and none for verse.

The really interesting thing is that many of the students then said that they didn't know whether it was a bridge or a prechorus, so they just voted bridge. I'm not sure if that's because it was the majority the first time around, or if their instincts were kicking in (or a little of both). I then confirmed that it was a bridge, and played them enough of the song to hear that function in context.

The second class (fourth-semester theory students who have done a substantial amount of study of classical form) was a completely different story. On the first vote, 5 voted prechorus and 1 bridge (it's a small class). I asked them to explain their positions, and no one could. We listened again and revoted. It flipped completely. Not only was it 5–1 the other way, but the outlier told us that she changed from bridge to prechorus, meaning that everyone changed their mind. At that point we talked about why it was difficult (no context to make the ultimate judgment) and what contextual clues might help out. Then I played them the module before and after: both were choruses, meaning neither bridge nor prechorus could be ruled out.

Lastly, I played the beginning of the song through the first chorus and said, "now you have enough information," and we voted again. It was unanimous: the original passage was a bridge. (The first cycle was verse–chorus; the song has no prechorus.)

So why tell this story? Well, first of all, these were fun classes for me. But I think it illustrates how helpful some of the _peer instruction_ techniques developed primarily for science education can help out in a music class. For instance, forcing the students to come to a conclusion about an analytical question, but allowing them to do so anonymously, really involves a lot of the students more easily than in regular class discussions. It also seems to give them more investment in seeing how things turn out eventually, since they made an initial stab at answering it.

Having multiple low-stakes votes also encourages them to be okay with getting something wrong in the service of learning it later. That's something that I've been banging my head against the wall about, as these products of No Child Left Behind don't have a mental category for schoolwork that they are allowed to mess up on and be okay, let alone work that they are encouraged to fail at the first few times in order to learn from their mistakes.

Lastly, though it doesn't have to do with peer instruction per se, I think this process of having them wrestle analytically with passages out of context allows them to see how much formal function is tied to the musical features of the passage, not just the order in which things are placed. It also makes it clear which analytical decisions can be done out-of-context, and which need broader hearing to mediate between multiple options.

The peer instruction elements, though, do need some modification relative to their typical use in the sciences. Eric Mazur often contrasts conceptual questions with plug-and-chug type problems, favoring the conceptual ones for the anchor of course material and the peer instruction process. In music theory, it's often the other way around. It's the conceptual that they need to memorize, and it's in the application (which is anything but plug-and-chug) that the real learning happens. 

With this in mind, I'm finding the "inverted classroom" model really helpful: having them engage the conceptual material outside of class and then bring it with them (i.e., open notes) to class where they do the application with me and with their peers nearby. This fosters experimentation, offers opportunities for correction, and ensures that at least some of their questions are answered and errors corrected before they leave to work more out on their own. At least for my students here at CSU, this has made a huge difference in their understanding and their enthusiasm.
