As a graduation present, my advisor gave me a copy of a new multi-author volume on György Ligeti: _György Ligeti: Of foreign lands and strange sounds_ (2011, ed. Louise Duchesneau & Wolfgang Marx). My flights to Basel gave me a great opportunity to dive in to it in preparation for my own research over the next couple weeks. One of the things I will be looking at while at the Paul Sacher Stiftung is a collection of sketch pages from the years between Ligeti's opera—_Le grand macabre_ (1977)—and his first "major" works from the 1980s—the Horn Trio (1982) and the Piano Concerto (1985/87). When I saw that the new book contained an article by Richard Steinitz entitled, "Genesis of the Piano Concerto and Horn Trio," I skipped right to it.





The reason I'm so interested in this time period in Ligeti's career is that it is commonly held to be a pivotal time of stylistic development in Ligeti's career, as well as a time of stylistic crisis and even extended writer's block. However, in my previous time in Basel, I found sketch material that calls that "caesura" in Ligeti's activity into question. And in the course of my dissertation research, I found significant problems with the idea of a stylistic crisis at this time. There is simply too much continuity across this period, in terms of technique, style, and activity, for this to be a "caesura" or a crisis. Rather, Ligeti has put forward this interpretation himself, in order to cast himself in a certain light (see the final chapter of my [dissertation](/research/dissertation/)). With this in mind, I was curious to see if Steinitz has any new information or insights since his earlier articles and biography on Ligeti (in which he relays Ligeti's "interpretation" of himself, rather than the alternate view I put forward in my dissertation). And in any case, I will certainly have to reference Steinitz's chapter in anything I write on chronology or stylistic continuity during this time period.





In this chapter, Steinitz essentially continues on with the same narrative of Ligeti's career that he and others have put forward (after Ligeti). This narrative—told by Paul Griffiths, Jonathan Bernard, Michael Searby, Eric Drott, Richard Steinitz, and others—views Ligeti’s compositions primarily in relation to two key events: his emigration from Socialist Hungary in December 1956 and the completion of _Le grand macabre_ in 1977 (partitioning his career into three discrete periods). With the exception of Michael Searby, these same scholars focus primarily (though not exclusively, especially in the past few years) on Ligeti’s middle period and lay out a narrative that encompasses all the major works of this period rather neatly. This narrative, first proposed by Griffiths and subsequently repeated and refined by the others, is one of a stylistic _tabula rasa_ in Ligeti’s music of the late 1950s and early 1960s, whereby Ligeti eliminates the hegemony and function of the primary parameters of tonal music (such as harmony, melody, rhythm, and harmonic progression—these vary slightly from theorist to theorist), and then embarks upon "a process of gradual recovery" of those elements (Griffiths 1983, p. 112) culminating in the finale of Ligeti’s opera, _Le grand macabre_.





Though each scholar's telling of this narrative is slightly different, its general shape is straightforward, and it leads Griffiths to pronounce that the final scene of _Le grand macabre_ (a passacaglia containing "familiar chords"—i.e., thirds, sixths, and triads; p. 108) represents "the end of the world" (p. 108) for Ligeti’s music, or at least the end of a major period. The _tabula rasa_ of the late 1950s has been filled with all the previously withheld elements of tonal music—rhythm, melody, harmony, harmonic progression (the last of which Griffiths claims is first recaptured in this final passacaglia; p. 105), and even a traditional formal structure—and the process is now complete. Further, Griffiths sees in the works immediately following the opera the same kind of extensive working out of the new elements of _Le grand macabre_’s finale that Ligeti engaged following other style-transformative or epoch-making works like _Apparitions_, _Lux aeterna_, or the "Lacrimosa" from the 1965 _Requiem_. Steinitz speaks of a substantial "refresh" of Ligeti’s style (2003, p. 251) with the 1982 Horn Trio after a compositional hiatus and creative block that followed the opera (p. 244). Likewise, Searby writes of a significant "gap" between the 1978 harpsichord pieces and the appearance of the Horn Trio (2010, p. 101), which was the confirmation of Ligeti’s new style that he was seeking during this time of "stylistic crisis" (2010, p. xv).





The position of the Piano Concerto (subject of Steinitz's 2011 chapter) within this standard narrative is typically one of early struggle—beginning in 1980, squarely in the middle of this period of "stylistic crisis"—followed by precipitous output—beginning in 1985, once his new style had been confirmed and established in the Horn Trio and the first book of Études for piano (1985). Such a narrative can be seen in Steinitz’s biography (2003, pp. 315-16), Constantin Floros’s (1994) program notes for the Piano Concerto, and even Ligeti’s own descriptions of this work and this time period, which he calls a "stylistic caesura" (Ligeti 1983 interview with Szigeti; cf. also Ligeti in Conversation, pp. 67-71, and Ligeti 2007, vol. 2, p. 300).





Though Steinitz's new chapter adds more detailed explanation for this narrative than in the past, it is still the same basic narrative. However, as I explain in a draft paper on this website ("Ligeti's 'stylistic caesura'" on [this page](/research/other-analytical-writings/)), there are reasons based on both Ligeti's sketches and his finished compositions to call this narrative into question. Hopefully my time in Basel will allow me to flesh those out and work them into a publishable form, so that the problems with this narrative and all that it leads to in Ligeti scholarship more generally can be critiqued by the larger community of Ligeti scholars.
