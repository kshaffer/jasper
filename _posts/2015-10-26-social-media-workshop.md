*On October 26, I gave a workshop on social media and public scholarship for graduate students in the CU–Boulder College of Music. Following are notes and resources from that workshop, some of which were also part of my presentation at UT–Austin, [The Public Intellectual: Online Scholarship in the Humanities](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2015/10/public-scholarship-and-the-digital-humanities-at-ut-austin/) (slides for that presentation can be found [here](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2015/10/public-scholarship-and-the-digital-humanities-at-ut-austin/)). I hope these resources are valuable to others as well!*

## Audience and community

When people Google you or your research area, what do they find?

> "It is going to happen. Maybe not today or this week, but eventually, you will be Googled. . . . When it happens, you will want content you created to appear early and often in the search results."  
["The Googled Graduate Student,"](http://www.cplong.org/2013/09/the-googled-graduate-student/) Christopher P. Long

This isn't just about numbers or *search-engine optimization*. It's about connecting with the scholarly, and public, communities of which you are a part.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On public scholarship: it&#39;s about finding the right audience, not the right size of audience.</p>&mdash; Jesse Stommel (@Jessifer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jessifer/status/448263789117317120">March 25, 2014</a></blockquote>

Scholarly communication isn't just one way, though. Not only can our work be of value to others, but by engaging others with our work, we become part of a dialog in which our work benefits from the insights of the rest of the scholarly community.

> "[I]n building a community of readers, commenters and friends or followers, you are, in fact, cultivating a network of relationships that can enrich your scholarship."  
["The Googled Graduate Student,"](http://www.cplong.org/2013/09/the-googled-graduate-student/) Christopher P. Long

In this way, building an audience looks a lot like building a community. We don't do it through self-marketing so much as being a good colleague. A friend even.

> "[P]eople don’t just follow me or read my blog to download my research papers. This has only been part of what I do online — I have more than 2,000 followers on twitter now and it has taken me over three years of regular engagement . . . to build up an 'audience' (I’d actually call a lot of you friends!). If all I was doing was pumping out links to my published stuff, would you still be reading this [blog post]?"

## Building an audience/network/community

There are three main things we can do to build this audience/network/community:

- Publish work in open-access forums (or place a pre-publication draft in an open-access repository, such as [CU Scholar](http://scholar.colorado.edu)).  
- Create and regularly update a blog.  
- Be active on social media.

> "If you want people to find and read your research, build up a digital presence in your discipline, and use it to promote your work when you have something interesting to share. It’s pretty darn obvious, really:  
If (social media interaction is often) then (open access + social media = increased downloads)."

## Content

What kinds of content do we share on social media? (particularly when we don't (yet) have polished published works to share?)

- Original thoughts ― Twitter is a great place to share original thoughts in microcosm.  
- Responses and reflections to the work of others.  
- Curated content ― be known as the go-to person for the latest and greatest in your field.  
- Links to published work.  
- Fun/personal stuff.  
- (Hash)tags.
