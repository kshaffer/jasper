The folks at [Hybrid Pedagogy][HP] just announced a ["virtual unconference"][conf] that will take place at the end of May. This is exciting because it's a little like a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) and a little like THATCamp, taking—hopefully—the best of both. Proposals work like THATCamp (propose a discussion topic—*not* a paper—in advance, and vote on proposals at beginning of the unconference), but there's no travel stipend necessary. Of course, the physical interaction of a THATCamp gets lost, but the upside is many more can participate, and it's easier to archive the activities and the resources that are built.

It's also exciting because of the topic:

>The theme for our first virtual unconference in the Commons is broad, **"Critical and Digital Pedagogies"**:  
>What are some strategies you use to hybridize your class?  
>How has thinking about Digital Natives evolved?  
>How can we use technology to help build community?  
>How are the economic concerns of our students changing?  
>How do you use your LMS?  
>Anything goes. These questions are just a starting place.

These are questions that many university faculty are wrestling with, whether or not they teach online courses, and are particularly interesting to me, since I use so much technology and online activity in my in-person courses.

Time permitting, I'll be joining this unconference. If you're interested in the role of technology in pedagogy, or just the changing pedagogical landscape in the era of online education, check it out!
