Tonight we will discuss _tools and strategies for higher-ed courses (in-person, online, or hybrid)_. This topic is considerably broad, which we think will allow those present tonight to steer discussion according to their interests. Feel free to bring up anything you like related to this topic.

We will discuss in-person, online, and hybrid courses in turn. Though most of us likely teach only one kind of course, we hope this will give us an opportunity to learn from the practices of others, perhaps adopting or altering practices from another kind of course to fit our own courses.

As always, when we move from one scheduled question to the next, feel free to keep discussion a previous issue that is engaging.

And don't forget to use a public account and put the hashtag on every tweet so we can all read it! #profchat
