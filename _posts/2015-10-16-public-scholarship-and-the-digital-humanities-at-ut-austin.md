Next week, I will be at the University of Texas at Austin, presenting and leading sessions on music, public scholarship, and the digital humanities. As the title suggests, I will be posting many things before, during, and after the visit — mostly on Twitter with the hashtag #publicscholar. Feel free to follow along, especially during the sessions themselves. 

Following are abstracts for each of the sessions I'll be leading. If you're in Austin, I hope you can stop by! I'm still waiting to hear back with timings and specific locations for a couple of these, but I'll update this post once I have that info.


## What Are the Digital Humanities?

**Thursday, October 22, 4:00–5:30pm**  
**MRH 2.614**

What is the difference between "digital" humanities (DH) and traditional scholarly work in the humanities? Are they different in content as well as in form? Or perhaps neither? Are the digital humanities about "building stuff" or "breaking stuff"? Hack or yack? And is digital pedagogy part of DH, or something else entirely?

Kris Shaffer (CU–Boulder & Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing) will lead this open discussion of what DH is. The answer to that question is likely elusive, but it's not the answer that's interesting. As with most digital "innovations" in the academy, DH isn't as new as it sounds, but it does prompt us to engage questions that have gone unasked for too long, questions that get at the heart of what we do in the arts and the humanities, and the politics that frame that activity. Come listen, yack, perhaps even hack as we explore the philosophy behind our practice ― our praxis ― in the humanities.



## Online scholarly collaboration – a mini-unconference

**Friday, October 23, 10:00–11:30am**  
**MRH 2.614**

Humanities research is usually a solitary affair, but online collaboration opens up new options for inter-institutional and interdisciplinary projects. Collaborative, interdisciplinary, and/or digital projects allow us to engage new kinds of research questions, but they also come with additional challenges. What tools are necessary to foster online collaboration? Who gets credit for a collaborative project in an evaluation system designed around mostly individual scholarship and "first authors"? How do we balance connectivity with privacy online? These are the kinds of questions we will explore in this mini-"unconference": a participant-driven, activity-based session introduced and led by visiting scholar, Kris Shaffer (CU–Boulder & Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing).



## The Public Intellectual: Online Scholarship in the Humanities

**Friday, October 23, 3:00–5:00pm**  
**MRH 2.604**  
**Association of Graduate Ethnomusicology and Musicology Students (AGEMS) Colloquium series**

How many people read the average scholarly article? What do people find when they Google your name? 

The internet has opened up new means of communication and publishing that have changed (and are still changing) the way that we find information, engage with texts, and connect with others. These changes pose tremendous opportunities ― and challenges ― to humanities scholars. How do we ensure that would-be readers have access to our work? How do we ensure that our scholarship has the greatest potential to make a positive impact on the world ― or at least our corner of it? 

In this presentation, Kris Shaffer (CU–Boulder & Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing) will lay out some of the ways the scholarly publishing landscape is changing, as well as some of the ways that scholars can use new forms of digital communication to increase the potential impact of our work. Not only can the use of digital and social media increase readership inside and outside the academy, but it can open up new dialogs with those outside our scholarly disciplines, dialogs that can enrich our scholarship and form new communities that themselves have value.
