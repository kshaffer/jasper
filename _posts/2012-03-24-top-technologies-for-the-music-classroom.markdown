If you know me, you know I'm a technology geek. As such, a lot of it ends up in both my research and my teaching. There are a few things in the "technology" category that have been part of my teaching for some time, and quite a few new pieces of technology that I've discovered recently and begun to use with some degree of regularity in theory or aural skills classes. Here's a list of the top technologies I make use of in my teaching. Hopefully some of you will find it useful.

1. _The piano keyboard._ – Obviously, the music theory instructor can't go long without this, but it's also essential for students. So much so that we're moving the CSU musicianship (combined theory and aural skills) classes to the computer/keyboard lab next year. I'll report more on that next year, but I can say for now that the days when I've had students working in groups on voice-leading or transcription assignments, running to a piano practice room or pulling out their iPhone with a MIDI keyboard app is a big help.

2. _Music notation software._ – Essential for all types of assignments and, more importantly, all types of careers in music. Most of my students have settled on [MuseScore](http://musescore.org), though a few use [NoteFlight](http://noteflight.com). A few began with [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org), my preferred application, but they all switched to MuseScore before too long. I think a few more may stay with it next time if I were to devote more class time to it (or to individual projects while I walk around and help them over hurdles along the way) or make a few demo screencast videos. We'll see.

3. _Coursekit._ – [Coursekit](http://coursekit.com) is a new, free, easy to use course website platform, developed by former students of the University of Pennsylvania. The distinctive of Coursekit, relative to other course website platforms, is that it's interface looks and functions a lot like facebook (though privacy and security are much better managed than facebook), which makes it much more intuitive for both student and instructor. They offer unlimited storage of media in any format, a secure online gradebook, online assignment submission, login with a facebook account (so students can never use forgetting their password as an excuse for not doing an assignment), html syllabus, one-to-one and group chat, and other cool stuff. My students love it, too. One said that all of CSU should get on Coursekit (and one professor asked me about it because our mutual students talked it up so much), and another said she would cry if I switched to Blackboard. They have a demo course page on their website, so you can get a good idea of the look and feel.

4. _Variations Audio Timeliner._ – [Variations Audio Timeliner](http://variations.sourceforge.net/vat/) is a free, cross-platform application for formal analysis via timeline/bubble diagrams linked to audio files. It's really easy for the students to use, and it helps the students visualize the large-scale formal structures they hear. It also make it easy to compare passages from different part of a piece for similarities and key relationships. We used this so much in our Sonata Theory unit this fall that we rarely cracked open a score. (Great for taking a class of mostly vocalists through symphonic repertoire!)

5. _Video grading._ – I just started this recently, after stumbling upon a [blog post](http://www.friedtechnology.com/2012/02/friedenglish-video-grading-using-google.html) about it by Amy Mayer. In a nutshell, this involves loading up the submitted assignment on my computer (for my students, usually a PDF of a score submitted online—such as a voice-leading exercise or a transcription), and then capturing my screen and the laptop's internal mic to a video while I point at things in the score and talk the student through their assignment. While Amy's post talks about the free screen capture software, [Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html), I've been using the 30-day trial of [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) (the full-featured program from the same company, which I've also been using to make my video lectures/demos—just put those in an assignment for the first time this weekend, so no data on that yet). Both export videos directly to [screencast.com](http://www.screencast.com/), which gives a free 2GB storage account with good privacy controls. I make a folder for each student and send them an invitation to create an account to view that folder. That account is free, and only that student and I can see their protected folder. I've found two things so far: my grading is faster, and the students have reported getting more out of it and understanding my comments better. I think the latter is a combination of getting more information (since I can talk faster than I write) and getting a clearer explanation of what's missing in their assignment (since I can point directly to examples as I talk). The jury is still out on this one, but so far the results have all been positive.

6. _Clickers._ – I already wrote a [post](/2012/03/clickers-in-the-music-theory-classroom/) on this earlier in the week, but I've been enjoying using [Socrative](http://socrative.com) in class lately, as well. It's a free browser-based service that allows me to ask students a question, which they answer anonymously via a web app accessed from their phone, laptop, or tablet. As I mention in that post, this seems to get the students contributing more. I've used it to get students to break the silence and answer questions when they are tentative about sticking their necks out on a new topic in front of their classmates. I've also used it to focus discussion/debate to the two or three most common interpretations in the class. In both cases, students are more likely to give me their best answer, since it's anonymous (and since they can't sit back not thinking about it while a classmate carries the discussion). And once they see that a number of other people in the class share their opinion, they are more willing to speak up and defend that position as we move into discussion (even if the answer ends up being incorrect). 

I even used this in sight-singing on Friday, asking students to suggest the best place to change syllables while singing a modulating melody. No one was speaking up in class, so I had them pull out their phones and vote. For one melody, they all had the same answer. We sang it, it worked, and that was that. In other cases where there were multiple answers given, we talked through the logic of each, tried them out, and that helped them start to build a logic of how to determine the best moment to shift syllables as they modulate.

There are a couple other things I'm planning but haven't had a chance to test sufficiently yet to report, such as making videos to replace lectures and allow for more "active" learning in class. There are also some technologies we've attempted to incorporate this year that didn't work as planned. I'll probably write another post before too long with all the flops. I think I learned more about my students, myself, and the technology from the flops than the successes!

What other technologies work well for musicianship classes? What haven't worked so well?
