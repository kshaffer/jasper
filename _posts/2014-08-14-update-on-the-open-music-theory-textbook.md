Development on the open, interactive music theory textbook is well underway! We have taken on two authors to assist in composing and curating the remaining content: Bryn Hughes (University of Miami) and Brian Moseley (University of Buffalo). I have also been working with the team at [Trinket](http://www.trinket.io) to develop the interactive music notation modules that will be embedded in the textbook. They are nearly ready to go live!

The textbook now has a name: *Open Music Theory*, or OMT. When the text is ready to go live, OMT will be accessible at [OpenMusicTheory.com](http://www.openmusictheory.com). (There's nothing at that URL yet.) The textbook will also have a dedicated Twitter hashtag, [#OpenMusicTheory](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23OpenMusicTheory). Students and instructors using the text can use the hashtag to participate in inter-institutional discussions about the materials and the musical tasks it is supporting in their classes. 

Our plan is to have the textbook complete, but in "beta" form, by the time classes begin for the three authors. (less than two weeks away!) We realize that finishing a new textbook late in the summer will not give faculty time to replace an existing textbook with a new one. So while the text will be complete, we will take this year—and especially the fall semester—to test the textbook in our classes, in order both to improve the textbook as we go, and to share our experiences with others who may be considering a change. During that time, we will also substantially add to (and rework) the multimedia elements like video and interactive "trinkets."

We do plan, however, to have a complete unit for two-voice species counterpoint (a staple of first-year music theory courses) in "version 1.0" form by the end of August. This unit will contain instructional text, video demonstrations, interactive exercises, and recommended in-class and out-of-class activities for a "flipped" or "inverted" course unit on species counterpoint. We hope that many music instructors will consider adopting this unit for a portion of their first-year music theory course this fall. It will be a helpful introduction to the textbook and the trinket technology for those considering adopting it in 2015, and it can serve as a step-by-step guide for those making a first attempt at "flipping" a class. 

For music theorists wondering about the content, OMT will contain the usual core music theory topics, including those that support the study of twentieth-century music. There are a few unique aspects of OMT's content, though. First, OMT treats four-part voice-leading separate from the study of harmonic syntax. Second, its study of harmonic syntax incorporates a hybrid of Roman-numeral-based and function-based approaches that is informed by Ian Quinn's *functional bass* (though it does not fully include Quinn's functional notation). Also, OMT incorporates recent developments in the study of musical form and schemata by William Caplin, James Hepokoski, Warren Darcy, and Robert Gjerdingen. Lastly, the text includes a unit on harmony and form in pop/rock music, building on the work of Jay Summach, Walter Everett, and others. And, of course, unlike the current standard music theory textbooks, OMT is designed to support active learning in the classroom—flipped classes, project-based classes, etc. That means short, pithy readings, videos for demonstrations rather than content delivery, and interactive elements for practice outside of class.

Per our commitment during the crowdfunding campaign, all of the written resources for the textbook will be licensed with a Creative Commons ShareAlike license, and will be freely available for anyone with an internet connection. Likewise, the music "trinkets" will also be available for embedding on just about any website, and Trinket will be making the technology available for others to develop their own music trinkets, as they have done for their interactive computer programming modules.

For those who supported this project financially, we thank you again! Stickers have been made, and as soon as they arrive, "perks" for those who donated $25 or more will begin rolling out.
