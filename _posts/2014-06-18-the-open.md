This summer, I am conducting a crowdfunding campaign to build an **open-source, interactive music theory textbook** that is easy for instructors to use, customize, and augment with their own resources. For details or to make a contribution, watch the video below and **[click here to visit the crowdfunding project page before July 6.](http://igg.me/at/opentextbook)**

I hope this project will help many music theory instructors find readings and multimedia resources that they can provide, and tailor for, their students. 

This is also one of two initial projects for [Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing](http://www.hybridpedagogy.org/#publishing), a new long-form publishing venture that [Robin Wharton](http://www.robinwharton.com) and I are spearheading. This open textbook project will help Robin and me lay the groundwork for future projects with scholars in other disciplines. 

We don't just want to create one open textbook. **We want to open up textbook publishing—and academic publishing in general—finding new ways for scholars and teachers to create, disseminate, and customize academic resources** that include a variety of media types. 

We are happy to have the folks at [Trinket](http://trinket.io) helping us, both by providing us with a publication and development platform, and by providing **matching funds for the first $2500 of donations** to this project.

Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing has a second major goal for this and future projects. **We want to enable the creators of academic content to be paid for their labor and expertise, without placing that financial burden on consumers (typically students and scholars).** Crowdfunding is one way in which we hope to finance academic writing while still making the ideas expressed in that writing available to as many people as possible.

We hope you will join us in these ventures—creating an open, interactive music theory "text" "book," and finding an open, sustainable model for academic publishing.
