I was excited last week to send in my textbook requirements to the CSU bookstore (via my department chair). It was my first time making that decision on my own (though with some input from my dissertation advisor). I’ve decided to go with Steven Laitz’s _The Complete Musician_ (third ed.) for music theory, with Caplin’s _Classical Form_ and Gjerdingen’s _Music in the Galant Style_ as supplementary texts. For aural skills, I chose Gary Karpinski’s _Manual for Ear-Training and Sight-Singing_ and _Anthology for Sight Singing_. I’ve never used Karpinski’s material before, but I’m very excited about it.

There is one insight from his materials (and his book _Aural Skills Acquisition_) that has particularly challenged my approach as I am preparing for the new semester, and that is Karpinski’s approach to dictation exercises. Melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic dictation exercises are a staple of the aural-skills or ear-training classroom. For those readers who may not be familiar with the aural-skills classroom, dictation exercises involve the instructor performing a short musical fragment (usually on the piano) several times in a row, with pauses in between. The students are then assessed on their ability to notate that musical fragment on a staff with accuracy.

The normal order of business in an aural skills class is for the instructor to provide a number of clues before playing the fragment, in order to orient the student. In melodic dictations, for example, an instructor would likely play a short harmonic progression that makes the key obvious, count off the beats in the first bar, and tell the students the number of measures, the meter, the key, and maybe even give them the first or last note or rhythm. The idea is to provide the students what information they need to appropriately interpret the tune they hear and get it on paper correctly.

Karpinski points out a number of problems with this approach, and I agree with him whole-heartedly. First, the point is not to get students to notate each melody the same way that the instructor has it on his page. The point is to get students to _understand_ what they hear, and to accurately represent what they hear with notation. Part of this training in understanding means helping the students to hear music they’ve never heard before, and from it to infer the tonic (key), the meter, and the scale/collection of pitches used in the melody. Giving the students the tonic and the meter and playing them a key-defining progression beforehand takes the tasks of tonic inference and meter inference away from the students. As a result, one of their main activities in aural skills (dictation) fails to train them to do these two essential musical tasks, fundamental for any aural understanding or transcription of music they hear: inferring key and meter.

Karpinski’s approach is to tell the students very little before they hear the music. For example, “the quarter note is the main metric unit, and the tonic is E-flat.” Assuming the students don’t have perfect pitch (something he addresses in other ways), they have to listen and process the melody before they can put pencil to paper. They have to figure out what the tonic is, what the meter is, and what the relationship of the individual notes and contours are to the tonic and the metric grid. The result is a more conscious direction of attention on key, meter, and _function_ (the relationship of individual musical elements to the whole or to global referents). And that is what we want students to be developing most: discerning global referents like tonic and meter, and intra-musical functional relationships.

I’m excited to give these methods a try. The last time I did a melodic dictation, I’m pretty sure more ink was spilled on my notes laying out the “helps” to give the students than notating the actual melody I would be playing from them. Students can certainly grow under such a program, but I’m excited to see how much more effective their training can be when their attention is more focused on the functional relationships than notes in isolation.
