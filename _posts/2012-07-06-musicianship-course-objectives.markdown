In preparation for this year's Musicianship courses, I have begun to create a detailed list of course objectives. The objectives will guide both curriculum decisions (including readings, media, assignments, and in-class activity) and grading (the specific objectives will be the criteria/standards the students must meet in order to pass the class and earn specific grades). I am following Andy Rundquist's division of course objectives into _holistic_ and _content_ objectivesâ€”that is, high level objectives, such as _compose a minuet in the style of Joseph Haydn_, and subsidiary objectives leading to those higher-level goals, such as compose an idiomatic minuet melody over a given bass line.

If you are interested in looking at the specific objectives I've got so far, they are on my [github site for curriculum](https://github.com/kshaffer/musicianship-curriculum). I will be posting the bulk of my curriculum materials there, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (and perhaps some materials under a different CC license, but they will all be open/free in some significant sense). If you don't use github or just want to glance at what I have, you can download individual files or a zip file of the whole collection there, and visit again later for updates. If you use github, you can "fork" the project to base your own github materials on mine.

So far, I've just posted the high-level, holistic objectives for the entire four-semester Musicianship sequence (which assumes fundamentals mastery). These are the foundation for the specific content objectives I am currently putting together. A couple things are particular to our program at a Christian university, but most would be pretty widely applicable. I'm eager to hear what people think about this set of objectives as representing the foundation of "musicianship" we should be laying at the beginning of a music major's undergraduate study. Just what should a "musician" look like by the middle of their undergraduate program? (Obviously, there's no single answer, but perhaps it could prompt an interesting discussion.)
