## Cantique de NoÃ«l (O Holy Night) ##

This is largely the original music, with a new translation of two verses of the original text by Jessica Moyer, a friend from New Haven. The original text was much more explicitly Christian than the common English translation (which was made by a Unitarian), and Jessica's translation preserves that very well. I also arranged several instrumental parts that can be used for a variety of ensembles. Please contact me at first DOT last AT gmail DOT com if you would like those parts, or would like them set for another ensemble type.

Text: Placide Cappeau (bf. 1893), trans. Jessica Moyer (2010)  
Music: Adolphe Adam (1847), arr. Kris Shaffer (2010)
